encina is living with dissociative

identity disorder we talked about her

background her initial diagnosis and

recapped what it's like to live with

d.i.d tell everybody a little bit about

your life where let's start with where

you grew up

so i was actually born in riverside

california oh

right here baby yeah

and

i

grew up in goodyear arizona

okay so uh at the time

goodyear was like nothing but cotton

fields but yeah that's where i grew up i

lived in this one specific house

uh for like it was like 13

14 years or something

and then i moved all over arizona

and you mentioned in our premiere

episode that you're not working yes um

but you have been working in the past

what has your

work history looked like in relation to

did like what have you been able to do

and not do so when it comes to working i

can technically do

any job like it's it's not like i'm

being held back from anything

because of d.i.d um it's

right now i'm not working

because i was hired on

as like a seasonal person but i actually

had to go on medical leave right for the

depression so that's the only thing

that's really kept me from like really

getting back in there right

but the types of jobs that i've done

honestly like because i'm so into art

and creativity i've kind of bounced

around a lot and i've done a lot of

different jobs that just kind of

made me curious yeah yeah um for example

like i

i don't eat seafood i don't i'm not a

fan of fish or like anything like that

but i loved the art of sushi yeah so i

became a sushi chef yeah for a little

while you know just just like on the

side i wanted to learn how to how to

make the sushi and i loved how they

looked and

that's what got me into it you kind of

have this

this soul that goes with the flow you

have a flow soul like just whatever

suits your fancy or whatever catches

your interest you go into that

where do you think or where do you hope

that type of mentality will take you in

your life because that's a very exciting

way to live i think um so i mean i'd

love to be i i'm again i'm really into

art i'd really love to be able to do

some kind of like

at-home work where i'm just creating all

the time um

you know anything that i've done has

usually been about just creating

something

so

if it has to do with me doing like do it

yourself projects i'm like yes like

that's right up my alley so

um

as long as i can do something like that

i think i'll be like so happy yeah you

know like hopefully yes good i like that

now

your did diagnosis came in your early

20s remind our viewers on what led up to

that

so

honestly i'm not really sure like

how it like led up to it it was more

i had all these other things that i was

kind of struggling with my mom thought i

was just this troubled teen didn't know

what was going on and

because i was having so many other

things

it was starting to like stress me out

and then i think that's where a lot of

the symptoms for did started coming out

because a lot of people mistake

thinking that once you have did which

you get it from a child as being a child

um

but well it occurs during your child yes

you get it when you're a child and as

you're growing up

you don't always have symptoms

so some people are like i got did when i

was 13 and it's like well that's not how

it works it's like you still have d.i.d

when you're younger it's just your

symptoms started coming on at that time

so my symptoms started coming on in my

early 20s

and i had no idea what was going on i

was confused i

you know when i was actually diagnosed i

was very much like

uh no

that can't be a thing like i i can't be

trying to share my life with other

people like what's going on like i don't

think so and i was very in denial about

it um but the more i tried to deny it

and push it down

and like hide it the more the altars

were like well i'm gonna test you like

i'm gonna come out like i'm gonna do

this i'm gonna do that and it was it got

very hectic like i would there's times

when i like

lost days

where

i was like

i would think it was monday and it was

really like wednesday

because you've been an altar for the

last two days

so what brought you into that

doctor's office

and

what did that diagnostic process look

like so i was there actually for

depression

and it's somebody that i was seeing out

of her home and she was you know such a

sweetheart and she ended up moving

unfortunately so i wasn't able to

continue care with her

but

i was seeing her out of her home

and again just kind of going through

regular talk therapy and stuff and we

were doing um some cbt stuff

as well as um i forget what it's called

they're basically like she had these i

put in these earphones uh these

headphones and i was listening to like

these binaural beats like they're like

these specific tones that you listen to

that help to like make you feel better

and things

um

and

i was really anxious at that time and

she explained that basically

i turned into somebody else

and i started talking to her

as someone else and she was like oh okay

and was

uh no she said it was an older woman um

i don't know too much more about that

honestly like

it might have been devin since she's one

of the people that comes out a lot um

but

otherwise like yeah that was just kind

of how it came about and then

as i started to you know accept that

this is what it is

i started to you know

try to educate myself as much as i could

i tried to um

follow other people on youtube who had

like the id and like wanted to learn

about like their life and like how they

were kind of going through stuff and

um

i found a girl who

was going through all of the did things

and she was explaining oh well i

communicate to my alters

with like a journal and i was like

that's such a good idea i'm going to try

that so i tried it and we did it for so

long and

it was

yeah it was kind of

mind-boggling like seeing these

responses just appear

and you're just like

yeah and i'm like whoa

like it's almost like as if

you were like there's a ghost in the

house and like i'm gonna write the ghost

like a letter and the ghost response the

ghost responds and there's actually 11

ghosts and there's 11 ghosts yeah so

that that i just really understood yeah

i really felt that i get that

do you still communicate with the other

alters uh not as much through like i

still use the journal um with again the

alters that i'm not co-conscious with

but they're they're very

settled now

if that's the right terminology they're

they're not as active as they used to be

so whether or not like some of them are

a majority of them have

uh integrated into one one another or

they're just not being active like i'm

not really sure

um

[Music]

for like my main alters that i am

co-conscious with i still like

see that they're there so i'm like oh

i'm not like cured like type of thing

but

um

i see that they're there and i see that

you know minnie is still wanting to come

out like every day and stuff and she

still wants to play and um

but they're just they're just not as

active

how do you feel about that

um so so i have mixed feelings with it

i

love it and i don't necessarily hate it

but i kind of miss it because once you

live a certain way

and you have these like

they're almost like friends that you're

just like

you don't want to start to feel like

crazy or anything but you can talk to

these other people within yourself

and

you know when they're not as active

especially minnie like i'm so close to

minnie and i just hold her so dear um

that when she doesn't come out as much

i'm like oh like

like i i miss that sometimes like i'm

really not a kid person

you know like i love kids and i love

them like this but i don't know how to

be around kids so it's it's kind of

different with minnie being inside me

to where

i don't have to try and like pick her up

or like you know because i feel like i

would drop a kid like i'm so does that

make sense it does okay

as much as any of this yeah

i mean this is why we're having the

conversation to educate ourselves

when you say you talk to them

is there

is there internal dialogue going on so

like it can be internal or external okay

so you could you could just be in your

car

and in your head saying

all right well minnie simmer down or

devin what are you doing or whatever

yeah like if if there's something that's

happening a big trigger that minnie used

to have was anytime i was around like an

ice cream shop she would jump out and

get really excited about ice cream and i

had to

try to like settle that down

because when you're around people that

don't know that you have d.i.d and this

little girl comes out i scream you know

she's super excited you have to be able

to like communicate that with with her

and stuff so i started recognizing that

that was one of her triggers

and

you know i would start to feel like a

transition was going to happen and i

could tell it was many

and i can internally say not right now

but you can also

say not right now and get over oh yeah

ruled uh-huh

yeah oh yeah it can definitely happen

wow but again like i feel like i've

gotten like a better understanding and a

better hold on

how all of it works and stuff and

basically all of us kind of working as

like a team instead of being like well i

need more air time i need more air time

like type of thing you know

in addition to having the id which is

obviously a challenge itself

there are co-occurring disorders that

you have

one of them being major depressive

disorder with mixed features

when were you diagnosed with that

um so honestly it kind of

came about with uh so i was i was

diagnosed with that one specifically

actually pretty recently uh so i want to

say uh they just added on the mixed

features

um

it was i want to say maybe

six or seven months ago

okay um

but it all

kind of started coming about when i was

about like 13 or 14 when i was diagnosed

with pmdd

which is

pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder got it

okay

and you also have ptc ptsd yes complex

post-traumatic stress disorder

what is that so

how i would describe it is basically

like ptsd is when you go through one

severe traumatic event

whether it was like a catastrophic like

hurricane or

like somebody like abusing you in some

way but it's like one thing and you have

ptsd from that one

like thing

cptsd is when you've gone through it

multiple times you have reoccurring

traumas

you have

a lot of different like things that have

happened to you over time

so it becomes complex because

your

your trauma that you've gone through has

been so much more severe i guess what

was your trauma

i mean i've had a lot of traumas um

ever since like i was a kid like my so

my dad and his friends

this is where my did came from

ended up like raping and like molesting

me

[Music]

i've had

a lot of like abusive relationships and

stuff my dad actually at that time was

very abusive to my mom so

i had to

my mom told i don't remember this but my

mom told me that i like

watched him like drag her down the

hallway by her hair and i was like

chasing after them trying to protect her

and

so

i've gone through a lot

have you

[Music]

gone through everything you think you

need to go through to heal as much as

possible from that

no i'm still going through the healing

process i'm still

trying to find things that will work for

me um

i've gone through i've been in therapy

since i was like six years old i think

and

it's still a continuation of

what is gonna work and what isn't what

medications are gonna work what isn't

gonna work and so it's a lot of back and

forth it's a lot of testing and trying

and

work it's a lot of work and i think a

lot of people

they give up or they don't they don't go

to the doctor because they're like well

i know i've got issues i just don't want

to know about it

and

right now like i i want to know because

i'm desperate to heal

why are you have you always been

desperate to heal or is that a new yeah

yeah

do you believe that you will

you know lately i don't know anymore

why do you say that um

i'm 30 years old

and i've been in

trauma therapy treatment

treatments

i've tried medication after medication

because of the

mixed features that i have they found

out that i'm not

supposed to be on antidepressants

because

that can make things a lot worse

[Music]

it was kind of like described to me as

if like

you take these antidepressants and you

feel better about your plan

to commit suicide if there was a plan

which i don't have a plan

so

and that's usually what would happen

with people and they're like yeah so you

can't be on antidepressants so

i have to be on

and again just to kill the stigma

because it's called an antipsychotic

um which does not mean you are psychotic

i understand that

um

so either that or like a mood stabilizer

or one of the both

and you're

working with psychiatrists or a

psychiatrist i'm working with multiple

of them um

because

i was working with one and

she was out of town like this was like

over the holidays and stuff she was out

of town

and they had to cancel and reschedule my

appointment so much that it was going on

like it was going to be like two months

when i was gonna see her and i was like

uh-uh i was like i need something now

so um

that's actually when i went into like

the inpatient place and like had all of

that going through

but now i'm seeing

a new psychiatrist because she ended up

going to like another facility

um

and i

i'm seeing how this is gonna go it's

it's really frustrating when you know

you don't have consistency

so that's really what i'm looking for

right now is consistency when i get like

a therapist like

i want a therapist that i can stick with

you know see my progression with and not

have to

reopen all these old wounds and okay i'm

learning i'm meeting someone new so i

have to explain every situation again

right it's so good that you

know that though

most people do not understand

how to do therapy yeah they go in it

very blind they go in it very uneducated

it's not their fault it's just the way

the system is right now and they go to a

therapist one they don't interview them

if they don't like them that doesn't

matter they stay with them and then they

have a bad experience and just think

well therapy doesn't work yeah because

and it goes no that therapist didn't

work for you and what you needed and it

is a testing of trial and error yeah

perseverance a relentless pursuit it

really and your mental health is key

in going through therapy if you want to

heal you have to fight for it oh yeah

say that again you have to absolutely

fight for it yeah and that's what i've

been doing yes good for you to do that

how do you know why do you

know that and so many other people don't

because i want to

basically i explain it like i want to

want to live

i want to want to live

i've struggled so much

for so long

i just

really want some relief

yeah

in the life

where you're not struggling

as much

where your struggle is

what we consider normal

normal struggle

what does that life look like disneyland

wait the reason that's so funny is

because there was no thought it was just

like

disneyland that's my happy place like

okay so i

i describe it like

i have the

suicide ideation as in

i'm not planning on killing myself it's

just the thought of not wanting to be

alive

every day

and it's not a thought that ever leaves

my mind

and if i had like even if i'm having

like such a good time with somebody

because you can have great times but

still be depressed

if i'm having such a great time with

somebody but i had an on off switch like

a little light switch that i could just

pull to like

just shut my life down

i would usually want to pull it

but disneyland

i don't want to pull it why what about

that

it's just a happy place for me

it uh

the history behind it everything that

goes behind that place and like

that's just how i live my life i i

believe in magic

and i want to believe in

happily ever afters and

like

true romance and things

and that place just makes it possible

is it unrealistic to want that i don't

believe so

i think it's hard to find but i don't

think it's unrealistic

what would you have to do to

have a life that

made you feel that way

i don't know i'm still that's what we're

doing that's what i'm trying to figure

out

i get that that's what i'm searching for

well i like that you

know that you have to fight for it you

have to fight for it you're already

ahead of so many people by knowing that

that having that

you also have panic disorder and anxiety

when were those first

diagnosed so

i mean technically i've had it for a

really long time

but

being diagnosed with it i think i was

i want to say

maybe a couple of years ago that i was

actually diagnosed with it um

i didn't know

what

it felt like i've heard other people

saying oh my god i'm having a panic

attack and i was just like i don't

understand that like can you just

breathe and like calm down you know and

like

i would try to be there for them like

okay what can we do like what can help

calm you and stuff and you know most

people just are they're in a panic they

don't know um

and i started going through that

uh

you know a couple of years ago and i was

like oh man like

my heart felt like it was gonna like

beat out of its chest like i i felt like

i was like literally gonna die or

something and it would just get really

bad

there were so many little things that

just started becoming triggers where

like

i would just start having a panic attack

out of nowhere

um

i would take like an uber to work or

like into town or something and like

just being in the car i would like

okay hold on you're okay breathe like

you're you're safe you're in a car like

you're just going to work right now like

you're like i would have to talk to

myself like this and like do these

breathing exercises and like through all

of the therapy that i've been through

they basically teach you coping skill

after coping skill after coping skill

and

for me when my anxiety is is that high

like

nothing really works not even like

medication that i've been given like it

kind of numbs it a little bit but i'll

be awake for days with anxiety

so it's it's still a it's a struggle

you have slight ocd and adhd is this

true so yeah i do have adhd

and then uh slight ocd yeah

and you have the pmdd

i'm least familiar with that one can you

explain that so pmdd is basically it's

kind of like uh

you want to think of pms times 100. okay

so it's it's pms basically it's it's

like something that's like

grown out of pms so with pms obviously

both of them you're gonna have like

cramping and

uh

they should be normal cramps not like

debilitating cramps if you're having

debilitating cramps that could be

something else get it checked out

basically like you can have like a

little bit of depression and things like

that but with pmdd you're gonna have

like really bad depression you can have

really bad mood swings you can like you

can have suicidal thoughts and stuff and

it gets really bad so i started having

pmdd

when i

was i think i was

13 or 14

and i was i would be awake all night

crying bawling my eyes out like for two

to three days out of every month so we

we recognized that it was a hormonal

thing it was something with my period um

and

you know i'd just be up like crying to

my mom i don't want to live like i hate

life like you know and i was a teen a

teenager like really wanting these

things and

ever since it's just been this cycle to

really try and

hone it down and

try to figure out how can we get

the hormones and the

uh

all the other chemical makeup of the

mind like to just work together and like

be on a better scale

because everything's just been so hectic

major depressive disorder with mixed

features

c ptsd panic disorder anxiety pmdd

slight ocd adhd id yeah that's almost

all the letters in the alphabet

out of those eight

which one is the hardest for you the

depression yeah i i figured that would

be it

i want to ask you a question about the

d.i.d

it is often

confused

with borderline personality disorder epd

have you ever had that discussion with

your psych psychiatrist or ever been

diagnosed or misdiagnosed with bpd no no

so it's never come up on your right it's

never

they uh

i mean i i feel like professionals would

know the difference like a lot of people

don't know the difference yeah um but i

feel like the psychiatrists that i've

talked to have been very like well

educated and

the ones that

you know know about did because that's

usually what i'll um
