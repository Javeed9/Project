Speaker 1:
Hi Gabriela. Um, I understand that you are here today cuz you've been experiencing some low mood.

Speaker 2:
Yeah, I just, um, recently I've just, I'm just feeling down a lot and I can't really like snap out of it. Like sometimes if it's happened before I can just like get myself back on track, but recently I'm just finding it really difficult to do.

Speaker 1:
Hey, so it sounds like you've been experiencing some low mood and you're kind of struggling to get going a bit. Yeah, definitely. You've had low mood in the past, but it's kind of, you've been able to pull yourself out of it before, but yeah. More recently you found that harder. Okay. So I understand that you, um, you first went to your gp, you referred you here about two months ago. Um, can I ask what, what led you to go to the GP in the first place?

Speaker 2:
Um, my long-term boyfriend broke up with me and it was, it was such a shock, like I really wasn't expecting it and um, it just got me really down and I just felt really lonely and, and I didn't really wanna see people and she wanted to be in my own space and my mom told me I should probably go to the doctors and Oh, and, and he's referred me to you.

Speaker 1:
Okay. So it sounds then like you, you had that breakup and you weren't expecting it, so it kind of came out of the blue a bit and um, and that you've been on your own quite a lot so you've not been seeing people as much and, and it sounds like your mom noticed that there's been a bit of a change in you. Um, okay. And, and how have things been then since then, since that happened and since you went to the gp?

Speaker 2:
I just, nothing's really changed. Nothing's really improved. I just, I just feel down like everything's an effort and just feel distant from things and like I said, I can't snap out of it.

Speaker 1:
Okay. And how did you feel about coming here today?

Speaker 2:
Um, how's kind, I was kind of disappointed in myself because I feel like nobody else my age is doing this. Like I should have been able to snap out of it. Like it's just another thing that I've not really, it's another thing that's making me stand out for the wrong reasons.

Speaker 1:
Okay, so you feel like it's kind of odd or unusual to be Yeah. Coming to see a clinical psychologist? Um, I suppose I just want to reassure you that it's absolutely normal to, to have feelings of depression, um, and anxiety. It's, it's really very common and it certainly isn't odd or strange at all. Um, so it sounds like it was actually quite hard for you to come here today. Yeah. So what I guess led you to do that? Cause it sounds like maybe there was a lot pushing you against coming here today, but you've managed to come anyway.

Speaker 2:
Um, I'm just hoping that it's gonna help. I think I didn't, I didn't really wanna admit it because like it's just, just another failure. But my mum was talking to me and, and if she's, she's not really happy with the way I'm behaving and I don't really wanna disappoint her again and so I thought there's no harm in it, so she thought come. Okay.

Speaker 1:
So it sounds like partly you're doing it then for your mum cuz you're a bit worried that she Yeah. She isn't pleased with you at the moment.

Speaker 2:
Yeah.

Speaker 1:
Okay. Um, well I think it's great that you've come here and definitely there's a lot of evidence to suggest that psychological therapy, um, can help depression and particularly the type of therapy that we are gonna be doing, which is called cognitive behavior therapy. And I'll tell you a bit more about that as as we go on, but I'm just trying to find out a bit more about you today. Okay. Um, so I saw from your notes that you are a medic student.

Speaker 2:
Yeah. Um, I'm not currently in uni at the moment, but yeah, last year as a medic student.

Speaker 1:
Okay. So I guess, uh, why, what's, what's the reason that you're not in uni this year?

Speaker 2:
Um, I was like, it was, it was pretty tall first year, so they've then suggested that I took a year out. This is the break.

Speaker 1:
Okay. So just thinking, so that would be about six months ago, was it that your year out started? Yeah. Um, and it sounds then maybe like your first year was also quite tough.

Speaker 2:
Yeah, it was. I I thought it was tough for everyone, but obviously we'll take it in different ways, don't we? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>

Speaker 1:
And you are planning on, are you planning on returning?

Speaker 2:
Um, yeah, I'm gonna have to really so that, yeah.

Speaker 1:
Okay. Don't sound too sure about that though.

Speaker 2:
I think returnings probably that's what's gonna make everyone happy and I think, you know, at least I'll be able to, um, finally achieve something and get something right. So Yeah, like next year I'm gonna, I'll get through it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:
Okay. So it doesn't, it doesn't sound like you want to go back.

Speaker 2:
I do. Um, I, I do enjoy it. I just, I just don't feel like me at the moment and I just, it's a lot of work and it's a lot of pressure and, but that's what comes with it and you know, it'll work out for the best if I go.

Speaker 1:
Okay. Um, so I guess then there's quite a lot of thoughts and feelings about going back at the moment. Yeah. Um, I'm just wondering in the meantime, what are you, what are you up to? What have you been doing?

Speaker 2:
Um, well I've not really had much on the horizon. My mum um, her friend owns a restaurant and like she suggested that did a bit of waitress in there just, you know, for a bit of like money and stuff. Cause obviously I'm not in uni so, you know, I've done that.

Speaker 1:
Okay. How many shifts have you done there?

Speaker 2:
Um, I've only done one so far. Um, yeah, I don't know whether it's something that I'd probably go back to, but Okay.

Speaker 1:
How when was that shift?

Speaker 2:
It was, it was last week actually.

Speaker 1:
Okay. And, and how was it, I suppose I'm intrigued. Can you tell me a bit more about that?

Speaker 2:
Um, it was, it was different, you know, because it was like I could, I did enjoy it because there was like, it's just different aspects and I had to like, speak to people and like try to get their orders and try to remember it and stuff. Like I wasn't very good but I suppose like it was handy to have some money and like get out the house.

Speaker 1:
Okay. So it sounds like you, you quite enjoyed that then. Yeah. Um, what makes you think you weren't very good?

Speaker 2:
I just like, I was just a bit slur and people, sometimes they didn't understand what I was saying so I'd have to talk louder or quieter or slur and I got a bit confused sometimes with the orders and I just don't really think that I'm not really like a friendly, like people don't really think that I'm a friendly person, so they didn't really want to talk to me and stuff. I felt like I was like inconvenience in them by like asking them things and getting things wrong. But yeah, they said, they said that apparently, um, most people get like a few mistakes on a fair shift mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but then again she's my mom's friend so

Speaker 3:
That's

Speaker 2:
Probably why she's saying it.

Speaker 1:
So the person who owns a restaurant is your mom's friend? Yeah. Um, okay, so it says you, you're saying that you, you think you weren't very good and that's cuz you were a bit slow and you got confused with some orders. Yeah. Is it, but you said it's common for people to do that on that first shift?

Speaker 2:
Well, that's what she said to us, but um, but it's probably just, she's just trying to make me feel better. She probably felt sorry for me because I'm obviously not very good at it. Like, I'm not very good at any things. Recently I think she just felt sorry for me.

Speaker 1:
Okay. So I've just been loading down some of those thoughts that you've been having. You kind of say that you feel like you're not very good, you're slow, you are, uh, confused with the orders. Um, you feel like you're inconveniencing her and she feels sorry for you. Um, I suppose I'm wondering, I mean, what makes you think that she feels sorry for you?

Speaker 2:
Well, like, like I said, she's my mom's friend and she's obviously feeling sorry for my mom as well because she's got a daughter that's not like anyone else of her age and she's just like all alone and she's not getting involved. So I think she just feels sorry for me and she doesn't wanna like, say anything to upset me.

Speaker 3:
Mm-hmm.

Speaker 2:
<affirmative>. Okay.

Speaker 1:
When you're having these kind of thoughts, cuz that's quite a lot of negative thoughts you are describing, how do you feel?

Speaker 2:
You feel empty? I don't, I'm just calling as it is. I'm just calling it as reality and I, I feel like I'm being honest with myself by just voicing it and not trying to get around hiding it because I know like I can see it in myself.

Speaker 1:
So it sounds like you feel like those thoughts are very true then. I mean, if you were gonna rate them, uh, Sam, I'm gonna pick out some of those thoughts you described. He said I'm not very good, um, and I'm inconveniencing them. How much would you say you believe those on a scale? Um, out of a hundred,

Speaker 3:
Um,

Speaker 1:
Where a hundred is like, I absolutely believe it and zero is like, I don't believe it at all.

Speaker 2:
About 80.

Speaker 1:
So you, yeah. So you feel quite sure that you definitely believe those. Okay. And you said that when you are thinking those thoughts, you start to feel quite empty?

Speaker 2:
I just feel distant and like I said, I'm not really myself, I just like, it's like I'm not really there, but when I am I can't even do a good job and,

Speaker 1:
Okay. Are there any other emotions that you experience?

Speaker 2:
I feel drained. I don't feel like I'm in touch with anything, just, it's like everything's going on around me, but I'm just not there. I'm just, it's like, I'm just watching.

Speaker 3:
Okay.

Speaker 1:
So you feel empty, distant, you feel drained. Um, and how, when you're feeling these emotions, how do you feel in your body? Kind of what sensations do you notice?

Speaker 2:
I dunno how to describe it. I get like, I have a bit of like, like, you know when you kind of get like butterflies when you're nervous and stuff

Speaker 3:
Mm-hmm.

Speaker 2:
<affirmative> kind of get a bit of that.

Speaker 1:
Did you feel some butterflies? Yeah. Did you have butterflies that night when you were at the restaurant?

Speaker 2:
Yeah, but I was pretty nervous then, but when I got into it, they went away and like, it distracted me for a bit until obviously I realized that I wasn't doing a very good job.

Speaker 3:
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

Speaker 1:
Okay. And when you, when you have those emotions, how does it affect your energy levels? Do you feel more energetic, less energetic, or about the same?

Speaker 2:
When I'm feeling down.

Speaker 1:
Yeah. When, when you're having those emotions that you were describing?

Speaker 2:
I just feel drained. Like I didn't even have like, the energy to wake up in the morning sometimes like I just feels pointless and like my body's heavy and I don't wanna, yeah.

Speaker 1:
So it sounds like you feel very tired, you are struggling to wake up. Yeah. You said it's pointless. And, um, what do you do then when you feel like that? So I guess you just talked about when you wake up in the morning and you feel heavy and I, I suppose you've been maybe having some of these thoughts and those emotions potentially the night before. What do you then do? How do you respond to that?

Speaker 2:
I just have to get off I suppose. I don't really have a choice because my mom, I live with my mom and I know it's hard for her, so I don't want her to be too worried. So I just, I just try to carry on as normal. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I get up, it takes longer and I don't want to, but I do and I'll get on with my routine.

Speaker 1:
So you're a bit slower in get getting up? Yeah. But you are still getting up anyway. And what about your kind of, what do you think about when you're doing that?

Speaker 2:
I'm just thinking that nobody else is like me. It's my age. Like nobody should be feeling like this and it, I'm the only one that does.

Speaker 1:
So it sounds like you think a bit more about the problem and you kind of spend time thinking about how you see it.

Speaker 2:
I hate having it. I don't, I don't want to feel like this, but I do Okay. And nobody else I know does. So it makes me feel even more alone and like getting even more down and I just don't wanna disappoint anyone and I, I just don't really want it.

Speaker 1:
Okay. So it sounds like you try and toughen up on yourself a little bit, tell yourself to work harder to be different. Yeah. Okay. And, and when you start telling yourself that kind of thing and how does that make you feel? Does that make you feel better afterwards or worse?

Speaker 2:
It feels worse because I still can't snap out of it. Like, I'm aware it's happening and I just, and I'm trying, but I just can't. And then, and then it's just another thing that I'm feeling at, it's just another thing that I can't really get.
