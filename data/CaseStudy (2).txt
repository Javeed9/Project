said that when you're in work you worry

a lot about how you come across in

social situations yet really makes me

feel really anxious like what I look

like and what people are thinking yeah

you said that you worried that you and

visibly shake yeah

and are there any other things that you

worry that people will notice I think

obviously the shaking I think my hands

and legs shaking and kind of going

really red and sweating and just looking

really weird so it sounds like you have

quite a strong mental image of how you

see yourself when you're in these social

situations yeah you so you go red you

shake so anything else that you think

that you do I mean describe yourself how

do you think you look when you're in

these situations just like I think I

just look really obviously weird and out

of place and like really red and just

visibly shaking and sweating and kind of

not being able to communicate properly

with people and is there anything that

you do to try and kind of defend against

these things to manage and these

problems and I guess like when I'm

holding the camera I just grip onto it

really really tight and or I kind of

clench all my muscles and just find

something that I can focus on and to

kind of try and make myself shake less

and not it was red and stuff mm-hmm

so you focus on something you grip onto

the camera do you make eye contact with

people no I just tend to just look down

okay so you also avoid eye contact is

there anything else that you do to

manage the sweating for example I just

as I said of looking down and like

wearing all black so it's less obvious

and kind of worrying yeah just more

layers and all blacks is you just can't

tell mm-hmm okay what'd you think would

happen if you stopped doing these things

if you stopped gripping onto the camera

or you know you started making eye

contact and not looking down and what do

you think would happen I think it would

be so much worse so yeah I think I just

would just shake even more and be more

anxious and look up more obviously kind

of weird and out of place mm-hmm I'm

what I'm thinking now is how would you

feel about if we did an experiment to to

test out your thoughts on what would

happen if you stopped doing these things

if we did a bit of a roleplay where we

pretended to enact a situation at work

okay and if we did this maybe twice and

the first time you do all the things

that you normally do okay and grip onto

something look down and is there

anything else that you do when you're in

these situations these were

conversations to try and cope and I just

kind of all just like fumble and like

kind of just clenched whatever whatever

it is I'm holding just really tight and

just make sure I don't make any eye

contact all right that's all just kind

of get through it okay so in the first

time I want you to do those things as

much as you normally would in fact maybe

even slightly more than you normally

would

okay and then the second time I want you

to drop doing those things all together

okay is that sound okay try my best and

and do how would you feel about if we

filmed this so you could actually see

what you looked like okay do you have a

camera with you that we could video on

yeah and Matt is my friend okay yeah

yeah we'll use that in just a sec okay

before we do this then we're just going

to fill out this form it's sir because

what we're doing now is an experiment we

call it a behavioral experiment to see

what happens when you change the way

that you're behaving okay so the first

column says I need to fill out an

experiment test this thought that you

have so that our experiment is going to

be that we do a conversation at work and

who should I play if you're playing

yourself in this role play who should I

be and maybe like a client at work I

always have to sit down with clients

before we do the shoe and kind of get to

know a little bit more about what they

want okay so would it work if I was

maybe having a wedding and I was hiring

yeah wedding photographer yeah what kind

of problems do you see coming up in this

conversation that we have like what we

see yourself doing on camera

I'm shaking like being really obviously

shaking and okay bright red and okay so

visibly shaking so how how much will you

be shaking 400 is like shaking

uncontrollably and zero is not shaking

at all how physically shaking will you

be 90 okay and but sorry what was the

other thing that you just said and okay

go really red okay so I'm gonna go red

yeah and how red will you go I mean if

we look around this room and probably

like the chairs okay thanks hello yeah

you're going to be as kind of brightly

pink as these chairs are yeah okay

so out of a hundred then how how pink

would you say these chairs are ninety

how hundred okay and what else you

worried is going to happen when we have

these conversations just worried I'll be

safe like say something stupid and not

be able to kind of get what I'm trying

to say across properly okay and how

stupid out of 100 if 100 is ridiculously

stupid probably like similar 90 and

created say and what I'll see you

worried will happen when you have this

conversation where else it might you see

on the camera I think you'll probably be

able to see the under it sweating and

okay and how much will you be sweating

and again 90 I think like weird like

visibly sweating down the face oh yeah

okay and what you think will happen the

second time around when you stop kind of

doing the things you normally do to cope

when you maybe start to make eye contact

and you're not gripping on something I

think it'll be even worse nothing cool

yeah

how much worse slightly worse like twice

as bad twice as bad okay yeah okay right

if you can you give me a fine animal

yeah

okay should I just use this and yeah

yeah it's probably best okay hmm okay hi

so um I was just wondering if I could

talk to you about maybe doing my wedding

photography yeah Oh what kind of kind of

what kind of things you see and how do

you want it to be like I suppose I'd

like lots of shots of our family and our

friends quite a lot of natural shots you

know people talking when they're having

drinks oh yeah

and you want it like do you kind of see

it being outside is that something that

you're interested in yeah shots it's

going to be a summer wedding so we like

like like a lot of outdoors shots and if

possible you know if it's not raining

that would be quite nice and yeah quite

some arty ones if that's possible yeah

and yeah that would be I've done quite a

few things like that before so have you

got anything that you could show me

about your past work yeah I recently did

them some sheets outside kind of in like

a wood environment so that I could show

you that maybe it would kind of help

with some ideas okay great

right let's do the second one now okay

okay you're ready to put down the bottle

and I take Mike I contact okay

okay hi so I just worry if I could speak

to you about doing my wedding

photography yeah yeah and what kind of

thing are you looking at how do you want

it to be like and I'd like kind of lots

of shots of family and friends and quite

a lot of natural shots you know okay um

are you interested in having things

outside maybe and he said it was wanted

it to be natural yeah it's going to be a

summer wedding and okay you know whether

dependent of course yeah it would be

really great if we could kind of get

lots of shots you know outdoors okay if

yeah people chatting and maybe some

quite arty ones as well yeah have you

got anything that you could show me up

your past work yeah actually it's kind

of a lot of the things I do are outside

and I'm really interested in getting

natural shots so and I could show you

some of my work and we could kind of see

if we could kind of develop something

from that could be quite good okay let's

pause it there okay Ryan's gonna give

you this back now to look at okay I know

I just want you to watch that okay and

then we'll chat about it in a moment

okay it's weird think if so if we just

go back to the things that you predicted

then you said that you thought you were

going to shake visibly shaked you see

yourself shaking on a video and

definitely not as much as I thought I

think it's obvious that I'm obviously

quite anxious but I don't think you can

tell I'm shaking that much mm-hmm so you

said that you were going to shake 90 out

of 100

how much shaking would you say that you

saw there and maybe like less than

thirty okay and you said that you were

going to go red or pink as pink as these

chairs 90 out of 100

did you notice yourself going pink and

not really actually definitely less than

I thought and yeah not as much okay you

said that you were worried that you were

going to say something stupid you know

at 90 out of 100

did you know yourself say anything

stupid not really

yeah yeah I was going to be a lot worse

than actually it was so you thought

you're going to be like 90 say something

that was 90 percent stupid that's really

quite strong I mean in the end did you

pick up anything that so could we maybe

put that as a cou maybe like less than

10 maybe here and you said that you

thought you're going to be sweating yeah

and that you're going to be visibly

sweating did you did you notice yourself

sweating in the end not really

definitely not as bad as I thought again

you thought you were going to be like 90

up and you're like seriously visibly

sweating so what what school would you

actually give it in the end

maybe again less than 10 I don't think

you could tell at all mm-hmm you also

said that you thought it was going to be

twice as bad when you stopped using your

normal strategies yeah what did you

notice watching that video it was

actually probably better when I wasn't

doing any of those things I think I

looked a lot more natural and I was able

to say what I was trying to say I think

I just come across more personable when

I'm not kind of looking down and stuff
