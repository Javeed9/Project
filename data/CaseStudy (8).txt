so high let hi thanks so much for

joining me this afternoon

so we're here to talk about some of your

experiences in accessing the NHS and

social care and maybe could we start by

you telling me about some of the health

challenges that you've experienced well

like I said before I've got lots but the

main ones are that I had polio as a

child which is now affecting me in

what's locally known as post-polio

syndrome and this means that some of the

problems of mobility and breathing

really really difficult at the moment

and that obviously has a big impact on

everything I asked to go to walk far I

struggle to remember things just just

generally lots of little things that

kind of mount up I have had other health

issues in the past I had unfortunately a

ruptured appendix which led to serious

bowel surgery that has got obvious

implications which I'd rather not talk

about

I had a pituitary trouble as a child or

mom trouble later I had the loss of my

husband who had a brain tumor and then

my parents who were very elderly who did

very well but had heals that I helped

look after they have now gone so yeah

I'm not had to easy yeah but I'm still

here and that's the me so it sounds like

you've very young age

the polio problem certainly did it was

bad at the time but unfortunately I

thought it was better I had problems

throughout my childhood like things

where I couldn't run very far or no you

know I couldn't understand where

everybody else could swim up and down

the swimming baths and I was punching

him found him but I didn't associate it

nobody told me it was the result of the

polio until as I got into my forties

fifties when this syndrome was like

garlic post-polio syndrome became

identified I wasn't alone other people

although few of them was suffering the

same way well I'm not unfortunately and

title to very much this is the other

issue I think sometimes some of some

established health issues better treated

than others so as far as the post polio

always eventually was able to ink its

ascertain a blue badge for parking

because it's difficult to walk far from

wherever I've left my car but every

three years I needed that reassessing as

if it was going to get better I do

appreciate that a lot of people take

advantage of these things but there are

an awful lot of people similar to me

whose health issues are not ever going

to get better

and it kind of feel a bit tree mail tree

did badly treated in having to go

through all these procedures again I

have bought myself a mobility scooter I

have bought myself a little pusher thing

but I've had to provide all these things

out of my pocket I know I'm lucky enough

to be able to afford it but you know

it's a bit of a two-tiered system

sometimes so what processes are involved

in reapplying well you get a form to

fill in you've to go to get photographs

again you have to

get a letter or something rather from

your GP to say that you are entitled to

this then you have to go to a board and

be assessed with people asking you all

these of the questions again watching

you walk up and down watching whatever

it is you owe problems you have and then

them deciding but yes you are okay and

unfortunately in my opinion this is only

my opinion I guess not always the person

who's doing this it's the right person

to be doing it some you know and I

appreciate that you can't always have a

fully trained doctor to out to do this

but some of the most of these people are

just administrators and don't really

know so how have you found using the NHS

well one of the things that's I think

has got more difficult over the years in

fact it's almost you but it's the fact

that you have now if you see more than

one doctor and you need to tell them

you've moved your address or this that

and the other

you've got to tell each individual

department separately when I first went

there you there was a you rang up when

you to their moving house and somebody

took all the details and that was the

end of it these days when I ran to tell

the limits at James is that I was moving

if they ask me which consultants I said

well which one do you want to know they

said well you have to tell them all I

said what individually said this is a an

electronic age and I have got to inform

a key Department yes I thought that was

crazy I thought that was absolutely

crazy

you had to ring each one of course you

know you know what it's like you hang up

you are in the third in the queue you

will be answered as soon as possible we

apologize and he listened to all its

music and eventually somebody answers

and then you tell them that many said

can you put me through to the new pump

I know you'll have to bring again now

that's just not some absolute nonsense

and you mentioned before when we were

talking about a oh yes partly as a

result of the polio my right knee was

okay but the left side was affected and

I spent a lot of a lot of treatment on

the left knee and the consultant said to

me about a time you 60 euros and he'll

be an absolute mess and you'll need a

new replacement and I went away and

thought well that's four years ago you

know I won't but for me but then of

course these things catch up with you

and somebody at work said to me you do

realize you're actually waddling and

your right leg is beginning to bend so I

said well yes it does a bit to be honest

so I went to the GP s-- who said well he

will send you for an x-ray and I went to

send to Chapel a little bit and this

x-ray and these days you're very good

this is a possibly energy that you

actually get a copy of the report sent

to the patient which said this knee

needs replacing

more or less ASAP and so I went to the

GP and said well I've had the coffee you

must have had one so he brought it up on

the screen and he said oh yes we'll send

you for some physio to which I said well

it says I need a new knee and he said oh

no we don't do that we have to have your

physio first you might get better and I

said well it's ER I says well anyway

I've got four I've helped private Elvin

Jones oh well you can go along now wait

don't straight away and referred me and

I could have lived on the next week but

the NHS procedure is you go for physio

and he had probably probably out to work

from weeks before I could have even had

that and they when I did actually have

the knee replaced which I didn't have

straightaway because of having to sort

out care for my parents the consultant

who did it so they should have been done

so far sooner it was a complete mess

they've been like if either way didn't

even longer probably melt because I know

that I know that I know you all want to

hear this but I know as an employee that

they in general do their best I think

the one thing I would advise is that you

really try and prevent rather than wait

until something happens we should try

and support the health service that we

have better
