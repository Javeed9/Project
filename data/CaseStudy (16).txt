what do you want to do is you look at

six-year-old little you

[Music]

sorry

rescue her mandy from the year 2021 this

is not the time to stay silent this is

not the time to stay small you let those

tears come if they want to come you are

allowed to express yourself

you are allowed to be heard

and she is too

go ahead and say why do you believe

we're unlovable

[Music]

[Music]

nice to meet you mandy thank you so much

for being here today

i would love to start off by learning

more about you and what you would like

to accomplish from today's session

and once i have an understanding of what

you'd like to achieve i'll tell you a

little bit about what you can expect

from hypnotherapy how it works what it

isn't

and then we'll dive into the session

does that sound good that sounds great

um so nice to meet you grace uh thank

you for taking the time today to dig

through this with me

uh

so

i'm not sure how much you want to go

into detail but

i have been through quite a few things

in my life

starting from a very young age

that kind of created some really false

beliefs that i kind of built my life

around

and

have been spending much of my adulthood

trying to unravel that and dig in

i have definitely had you know cognitive

behavior therapy some somatic experience

experiencing some emdr

because there is past trauma

but i still feel stuck like i still feel

like there's blocks

and not really sure how to get through

them

definitely so just to make sure i'm on

the same page there's definitely been

some trauma you've been doing a lot of

work around it but you're still

experiencing blocks and not sure how to

move beyond them

yeah

so let's start with how you would love

to feel

as compared to

how you actually feel day to day

um i would

and it comes in waves so it's not like i

always feel this way but there are many

times where i just feel like i need to

stay small

um

do

things to

you know

make others happy

i definitely was a perfectionist growing

up so like tied my worth to outcome a

lot and performance

and now i know that not to be true i've

done a lot of work around that but it

still really is kind of deep down you

know i'll find myself getting

lost in a project or just extending too

much of myself kind of

maybe subconsciously hoping for

um unconditional love or acceptance or

security that's you know somebody or

something won't leave because there's

been a lot of loss in my life as well

so i definitely feel like those are some

themes that that keep me small or don't

allow me to be fully myself like i'm too

afraid to show that side

if that makes sense

absolutely and so i have a couple

follow-up questions but the first is

what is the opposite

of looking of being small playing small

to you so

in your life what would be a very

tangible

example of

the opposite of staying small

um

being big

being big just being like

unapologetically

you know just myself um not really

worrying about

trying to mold around expectations or

what i believe others are wanting

if if that makes sense so i guess that

would be the opposite of just kind of

being out there

um

yeah i mean i

kind of along this line i like to public

speak right i was a teacher for a long

time i'm used to teaching in front of

people

so that to me is kind of being big but i

would like to see that

feeling or that fearlessness in other

areas

beautiful so that's exactly where i want

us headed i want to know what does

playing big

look like for mandy so

public speaking seems like it's a piece

of that perhaps being on stages is it

having a following do you have a message

is there a business you want to launch

do you want to win an oscar whatever it

is like this is the time to just share

probably the thing that's the most

terrifying to consider but also the

thing that lights you up the most what

are some of those things

yeah okay well

um

i

love to write and i love to illustrate

and i really love connecting

with people through emotion

especially shared emotions so to me

writing is very expressive it is a huge

piece of my soul

um i have created my own website i have

kind of put it out there but afraid to

grow it like i just

kind of put it there and just

let it sit and i let myself get busy

you know too busy to get to this too

busy to get to that and i know

i'm a single mom i'm a very very busy

woman i'm not

like totally used to that if that makes

sense so that's just almost like an

excuse really

um for probably some some fear behind

that

yes

so procrastination can take many forms

right sometimes people think

procrastination is laziness but for

example when i have a book deadline my

house is the cleanest it's ever been

right not being lazy i am just scrubbing

the floors

and so procrastination in all of its

various forms is actually a fear of

failure and so it makes sense that this

thing that calls to you so deeply that

is a part of your soul this writing

that you would become too busy when in

fact you are extremely busy and that's a

very insidious form of the subconscious

going no i'm going to keep you small to

keep you safe i'm going to keep you busy

so busy and actually busy that you don't

have time to look at this thing which

would make you vulnerable yep yep

so the subconscious always wants to keep

us safe and it typically does so by

attempting to keep us small

if you had to guess and there could be

another subconscious reason for it you

mentioned there's been a lot of loss in

your life there's been trauma

if you had to guess the source of the

fear of playing big the source of the

thing that's blocking you from writing

is there one thing in particular that

comes to mind that you feel comfortable

sharing

um there there are a few that i think

just kind of wove together over the

years um

i had some um

childhood um

sexual abuse that had happened very

young and you know persisted for many

years and just going through that kind

of always feeling always

not not allowed to say anything right so

just stay small just stay small do what

you have to do

to to make that person happy

don't draw attention to yourself

don't share your feelings keep it all

stuffed down and then i think to um you

know i love my family tremendously but

being

the oldest you know of your siblings you

feel great at first and you know you're

kind of doing your thing you're very

independent and then the others come

along and you love that but and now

being a parent of three myself you

realize how busy you get with each of

them and it doesn't mean you don't care

about them or love them any less or or

anything like that but um

but but it was a shift and it was you

know attention was diverted elsewhere

and if i was like trying to do something

or if i excelled at something

there was

encouragement of it but also

don't show off don't make other people

feel bad don't do this don't do you know

just kind of sit quiet sit pretty you

know do your thing we want you to be

yourself we love you

but you know tone it down

yeah if that makes sense so i think the

combination of those events just

yeah kind of built that in me absolutely

is so it feels as though there's a

correlation between staying silent

staying small

and you had mentioned that shared

emotion is so important to you

yeah can come together and have a shared

experience around their emotions and in

each one of these cases you had to

tamper down

how you were feeling and your expression

whether it was the fact that you were

excelling at something or the fact that

somebody was

causing you harm yeah so what we want to

do is find that shared link in your

subconscious

and set you free

in in all of these various ways and so

that means finding your voice and

feeling not just the safety to share

your voice there's a element of that but

also just the courage to do it even when

it's scary

yeah because even when all conditions

are perfect it can be scary

yeah and so we want to make sure that

we're boosting courage as well go ahead

so i love that um i was just gonna say i

don't know if this will make sense at

all but i have

i have no problem

saying what i need to say

for others

if that makes sense um i i have spent a

ton of time in advocacy service work all

of that i will voice whatever i need to

say i will stand my ground set you know

harden the truth but when it comes to my

own it's like

so that might be another layer that's

also impacting it so absolutely

absolutely

so what you don't need this particular

element but i i do feel called to share

it and to see what it brings up for you

because public speaking is a part of

your skill set which is something that

many people fear worse than death right

there's been studies that show people

are more afraid of speaking in public

than they are of dying

and the fact that you can do that with

ease is tremendous so when i'm helping

people overcome a fear of public

speaking in particular women one of the

things that most consistently has made

an impact is when a woman can imagine at

the subconscious level all of the women

who have been silenced throughout

history and even the women who are

currently silent that there are parts of

the world in you know 2021 today where

if a woman were to get on stage and

share her truth she would be stoned to

death or thrown in jail

and that when you get up and share

whether it's at a quarterly board

meeting about the numbers or whether

it's about the thing that you care the

most about changing in the world

you're standing up for yourself you're

sharing your voice and your truth but

you're also representing all those

silenced women and the fact that they'll

never get to do that in this lifetime

it's an honor it's a privilege and it's

a responsibility and we focus on that

for half a second and all the women are

like get me on the stage

so it's we want to be able to channel

that for little mandy

yeah

you know that that she has the chance to

be set free that she has the chance to

heal from the trauma that was inflicted

upon her that she doesn't have to be a

victim any longer

and she can do that for herself

but

she can also do that for other children

or she can do it for puppies who are at

the pound we want it to be important to

little mandy believe it or not it's more

important that we get her

buy-in and that she's excited to

transform and we'll do that in the

session um but in the same way because

you're already a natural advocate we can

use that as leverage in the subconscious

that like okay i'm doing this for myself

but i'm also doing it

on behalf of something i really care

about who will never have the chance to

do this does that resonate i love it the

second you said doing it for all the

other women or anybody that stayed

silent i got goosebumps i'm like okay

that's perfect i can do that good

perfect okay great so as long as little

mandy agrees we'll go that route

otherwise she'll pick the thing that she

wants to stand up for and we'll run with

that that's perfect

okay great so

would

success look like

feeling more confident in your skin

writing a book

expressing your needs more what's a

tangible outcome that if a week from now

you saw yourself doing it you would go i

have to call grace and tell her this is

happening

um oh my goodness there's i have a whole

list but um

one thing definitely i think just

being

being published first would be like my

biggest thing um that would be a

signpost because it's the one thing i'm

like that i'm

constantly stalling on

and from there it's like i i know

exactly what i want to do you know with

like expanding nonprofit organization

just doing lots of other things to help

people

um and and i have that association too

like if i'm a writer i can't also teach

i can't also still stay in like the

nonprofit world and help out like i have

completely compartmentalized these

things and there's tons of people that

do all that kind of stuff yes but

that's another so that would be my first

step yes perfect for the subconscious to

say oh you care about all these other

things you're gonna have to say goodbye

to them forever if you do the thing that

your soul is most calling for you to do

which is to finish your book and be

published

so

you said that you love to illustrate as

well is this a a children's book or is

this a novel is it so i have three three

so one would be a self-help book because

i have like a whole program lined out

for that

um poetry

and children's books

they're all and all geared towards

healing

what's your main signpost

uh little chicky marie it's it's a

children's book perfect

and are you cool with published via

amazon on your own or does it have to be

with publisher okay perfect so

originally i wanted to do publisher but

then i was like no you know what it's

it's just about getting that first step

and making momentum and the publisher

can cut you know

the traditional way can come later if if

so and if not you know it's all good

perfect i love that that takes out a

huge

barrier that is 18 months at a minimum

in the making and i'll share a dear

friend of mine who's also a client john

strollecki he wrote cafe on the edge of

the world

and uh it sold six million copies and

he's self-published and he was turned

down by 200 publishers six million

copies

cafe on the edge of the earth or cafe in

the edge of the world either one but

it's phenomenal either way whether it's

world or earth and um yeah so he would

he would say this is the way to go and

once you sell your hundreds of thousands

of copies then a publisher is going to

buy it for a lot more so that's very

exciting so little chickie marie

published via amazon self-published

that's your signpost that you've broken

free

is that right yeah yep awesome okay

we're gonna take a beautiful winding

road to get there but that's the

signpost that's the goal so

any questions or anything else you want

to add before i tell you a little bit

about what you can expect from hypnosis

no

um

no i think this this will be really good

because it's definitely impacted other

areas of my life from motherhood to

dating to all of that so

yeah so i'm excited i'm excited for it

absolutely i mean

the subconscious is just a bunch of

roots that are intertwined and we can't

even really know the subconscious

associations we've made but one of the

cool things is even though we're going

to work on you becoming a published

author and healing some childhood trauma

in order to

feel safe enough and courageous enough

to be seen in that way

you might find you get the best

sleep of your life tonight or you might

find that you know whatever else is

going on if there's a i don't even want

to make suggestions but i'll give you an

example i had a client who called me a

couple days ago and he went grace i

didn't even tell you this but i've been

a smoker for 25 years

and we haven't worked on quitting

smoking but ever since we had our first

session three weeks ago i haven't had a

cigarette so what was that all a bonus

miracle right because he started

elevating his self-confidence his

self-worth his love of himself and and

his confidence the things that were

self-harm

but shrouded in a light of

stress relief yep we're unnecessary so

be on the lookout for bonus miracles

they could be anything

i love that that sounds like a little

bit of fun and magic and whimsy so let's

do it

perfect okay so you've done cbt emdr but

never hypnotherapy

no

no

all right so now i'm going to share with

you a little bit about what hypnosis is

how it works why it works what it's not

and that will just help you to get even

more out of the session because we'll

know that your expectations are in

alignment with reality and not what

hollywood portrays so you mentioned

early on you've done cbt cognitive

behavioral therapy emdr uh but not

hypnotherapy correct

i have um

done a little bit i do have your app and

um i love it actually one of um

in the beginning i love i can go now

like right to

down the staircase right to where i want

to be i know exactly what it looks like

and it's become a favorite meditation

you know escape for me as well so i have

some experience but

not um you know the reciprocated

one-on-one experience so

fabulous well thank you i'm honored and

for everyone listening you can get the

app at getgraves.com forward slash med

circle

you will love

it so just as you said i call hypnosis

meditation with a goal

and when you're listening to a hypnosis

recording it feels very similar to any

meditation recording the slight

difference being that it's if it's

hypnotherapy then that person has

specifically studied how to reprogram

the subconscious mind whereas if it's a

meditation from a meditation app it

could be just someone who likes to relax

and thinks they know how to make a

recording which is fine and you know

there's great intention behind that but

it's not going to be anywhere near as

effective as someone who studied how to

specifically weed out what's not serving

you plant what you desire water it let

it grow and then future pace you into

the life of your dreams so that's the

distinction between recordings of

meditation and hypnosis they feel the

same it's more about the credentials of

the person making them

and then when it comes to what we're

going to do today one-on-one

hypnotherapy

it the the name hypnotherapy is a little

bit of a

conundrum because we're not licensed

mental health practitioners we're not

therapists we're not psychologists we're

not psychiatrists we don't diagnose we

don't treat disorders that's what all of

the other brilliant genius doctors on

med circle are for

uh what i really am is an expert in the

subconscious mind and so the way i kind

of view my role in the world is it's as

if i say okay mandy let's go i take your

hand and i've got a lantern i press the

button i take you down into your

subconscious and i know what happens if

we go left i know what happens if we go

right but i'm holding up the light and

saying what would you like to do where

would you like to go what empowers you

most and so you're the one making all

the change you're the one doing all of

the healing i'm just your guide and then

i bring you back up through your

elevator and your life is phenomenally

better than it was before we went down

and from a scientific perspective

here's why

so most of us attempt to change our

lives when we're completely stressed out

if we were to put sensors on our head

and read an eeg machine we would see

what's known as the beta brainwave state

when we're in normal waking

consciousness so you and i having this

conversation we're in beta the waves

we're producing would look like this so

spiky fast put together

that's fight flight freeze survival mode

that's where stress comes in it's where

we are our least able to take in new

information it is our least adaptive

state and it's usually when we attempt

to change our lives which is why it's so

difficult to stop eating the chocolate

or go to bed earlier quit smoking or do

any of the things when we're in the

shower for example and we're a little

bit more relaxed the negative ions from

the running water the fact that we're

doing something rote like washing our

hair

we're able to drop down into what's

called the alpha brainwave state which

looks like this on the eeg which is

daydreaming and when we're daydreaming

sometimes we get those light bulb

flashes of inspiration so our intuition

can speak to us because we're a little

bit more relaxed

and then way down here where things

barely move is the delta brainwave state

that's sleep so when we're asleep we are

unconscious

we're not aware of the fact that we're

in our bed right if there were a moth

flying around we wouldn't know

but our subconscious is alive and well

during the rem cycle of sleep when we're

dreaming so movies make it look like

hypnosis takes place in delta it makes

it look like it's happening when we're

asleep that is just hollywood wanting us

to have a reason to believe why a

character who would not behave a certain

way is behaving that way it's that's all

it is the truth of what hypnosis is is

we drop down into what's known as the

theta brainwave state so it's deeper

than alpha it's deeper than daydreaming

but it's more alert and conscious than

sleep so the theta brainwave state is

where you can connect 100 to your

intuition

to your inspiration

and where that critical factor of the

mind that goes i could never do that

that's stupid i'm scared a million

people have done that before everyone

will make fun of me all that critical

factor of the brain

is

off in the corner not paying attention

and we can finally dream big

so a study found that 600 sessions of

psychotherapy on average resulted in 38

improvement over the course of 600

sessions

so

that's beta that's when we're talking

about our problems from the conscious

mind and that's wonderful 38 improvement

is a huge amount of improvement that's

about 10 years of talk therapy which is

awesome and again there are very

specific reasons to do that that a

hypnotherapist can't help you with right

we can't treat disorders we can't

diagnose so awesome perfect love it we

work together great

same study found that six sessions of

hypnotherapy results in an average of 93

percent improvement

and that's because we're doing it from

theta where there's no critical factor

of the mind telling us it's impossible

and where we have the surplus energy

required to create new connections in

the brain very quickly so dendrites

extend out from the neurons and connect

and make new neural pathways

that much faster it's it's like

lightning speed so that's what we're

going to do there's a whole lot more

about why hypnosis isn't mind control

and all of these things that i've talked

about in other med circle videos so i'm

sure

anybody who wants to know more can find

those but i feel like that's enough for

you to understand

why you're going to be aware that you're

sitting in your home why you're not

asleep why

you are conscious and alert but still

deeply relaxed so any questions

no

okay

perfect staircase forming before you

it might be one you've seen before or it

might be brand new

so long as it's your perfect

staircase

you're doing it right

it could be sleek and simple or

elaborate and ornate

whatever you notice is perfect and

correct really good

and this perfect staircase is going to

lead to your safe

place

a place where you feel so wonderfully

deeply relaxed and perfectly safe that

lasting transformation to your

subconscious mind takes place

it could be a beach

garden a mountain top

a penthouse a yacht another planet which

is to say it can be anywhere

so long as when you get there

you feel perfectly wonderfully deeply

relaxed and safe

when you're ready the sound of your own

voice taking you even deeper describe

for me in just a few words

what your perfect

staircase is like

it is old cobblestone

it is old cobblestone that's right what

else

it's cool on the bare feet

it's cool on your bigger feet that's

right what else

and it opens to a beautiful enchanted

forest

yes it opens to a beautiful enchanted

forest

so when you're ready to go and head down

those steps into your safe enchanted

forest

you'll let me know by saying out loud

i'm here

it's perfect and i'm ready

i'm here

it's perfect and i'm ready

that's exactly right

you're here

and you're ready

perfect staircase now

inhalations

breathing in the pleasant fragrances the

pleasant smells they're inside your safe

place

reach out and touch something there

inside your safe

enchanted forest

feeling its texture or its weight its

roughness or smoothness

and now reach out and touch something

else there that it's a very different

texture

good hear the sounds inside you're safe

enchanted for us

notice the colors inside your safe

enchanted forest

perhaps there's even something

nutritious and delicious for you to

taste there inside your safe

enchanted forest even if it's just a sip

of cool clean clear water you can go

ahead and taste that now

and then when you're ready the sound of

your own voice is taking you even deeper

go ahead and describe for me

what stands out to you most about your

safe

enchanted forest

there are lots of animals there

that's right there's lots of animals

there what kind of animals

um

beautiful

baby deer

lots of birds raccoons squirrels

they're all just hanging out

that's right

how does it feel emotionally to be there

inside your enchanted forest with all of

these animal

space and peaceful and

joyful

safe and peaceful and joyful

amplify and magnify how safe you feel

amplify and magnify how peaceful you

feel

amplify and magnify how joyful you feel

and allow

that joy

to flood your system

the visual i get is like this happy

joyful

acidic rain believe it or not because it

breaks down and dissolves and melts away

all of the calcified pain does that

resonate

yes

so really amplify magnify that joy

and allow it to just pour all over your

body your mind your emotions your energy

amplify magnify that joy and it just

completely dissolves all of the

calcified pain that it touches

and you feel lighter and lighter and

lighter more and more free

take your time now while i'm silent to

allow this joy to work its magic

and share with me once you know you're

complete

i feel complete

that's right you feel complete

and what was that experience like as the

joy

is amplified and magnified

it felt so loving

it felt so loving

and is this a sensation that you feel

with regularity or is it rare or

something else

no

i don't feel it regularly

yeah that's right

in the past you didn't feel it regularly

but now you know that you can come here

to your safe place it's just down the

cobblestone stairs

surrounded by these animals

and you can fill up on joy and feel that

love

whenever you'd like

how does it feel to know that you can

access it this easily

wonderful

wonderful

when you are worthy and deserving

of having that wonderful experience as

often as you'd like

so now go ahead and see feel and

experience that somewhere there inside

your enchanted forest

is a circle of animals

waiting to be read to

and they want to hear their favorite

book little chicky

marie so find that circle of animals

ready to be read to

find published beautiful little chicky

marie

and when you hold that book in your

hands you can see that the spine

has been opened

thousands of times

it's their favorite book

take your time and read it to your

animal friends your published children's

book

take all the time you need and describe

for me which you notice when you're

ready

they are happy to hear it

because it

makes them hurt less and smile

yes they're happy to hear it

because it makes them hurt less and they

smile

and in this situation what's the

opposite of hurting less what does it

make them feel more of

peace and joy

yes

so your book

helps your readers

feel more peace and joy

is that right yes

beautiful

so i'd like for you to notice that

there's another group of animals maybe

they're teenagers if it was the little

kid animals who were just listening

now you're gonna find the next circle

the circle of teenagers and as much as

they love little chicky marie and they

do

they want to hear from you

the journey

that it took

for you

to write it

to publish it

and most importantly to overcome

the blockages that stood

in the way

but before you can share with that

circle that story

you'll have to remove the blockage

so we're going to go on a journey

together

on a voyage on an adventure

to discover what the blockage or

blockages are

so that you can summon the courage

to destroy them

to overcome them to remove them

and to be victorious

you already know it's done in one realm

now it's just a matter of connecting the

dots

take all the time you need and when

you're ready to begin this journey

let me know by saying i'm ready

i'm ready

that's right

you are

ready

so when i count down from three to one

and snap my

fingers someone or something is going to

appear as the personification of the

fear that's stopped you from writing

little chicky marie the first of your

many books

the personification of the fear that's

been stopping you

it might stem from an experience in

childhood

it might be from something someone told

you

when you were a kid

it could be absolutely anything from any

direction of time or space

the personification of the fear that's

been stopping you from writing your

truth

the fear that's been keeping you silent

and small

but remember

this is your enchanted forest you're the

boss you call the shots

so whenever this thing appears if you

want you can immediately put it in a

bubble so that it can't touch you or

talk to you or get close to you

you're the boss

three going even deeper getting ready to

experience the personification of this

fear before you

two it could appear as a boulder or a

witch or a frog or a blue dot which is

to say however it appears is perfect and

correct

and one

see feel and experience the

personification of the fear before you

notice what you notice and describe for

me what that is when you're ready

it's the grim reaper

that's right

it's the grim reaper

and he's just standing there and he's

very stoic and quiet and not budging

that's right it's the grim reaper he's

just standing there and he's very stoic

and quiet

and he's not

budging

that's right

how do you feel observing this grim

reaper standing before you

when he first appeared he

just said

you are unlovable

and

then he got quiet

and it hurt really bad

to hear that

but as i'm staring at him

he just looks like a statue

yes

when he first appeared he said you are

unlovable

and then he got quiet and it really hurt

but now as you look at him he just looks

like a statue

when i count down from three to one and

snap my fingers the voice that you heard

that message from you are unlovable will

ring loud and clear and you'll tell me

who it is three going even deeper even

if it was yourself too or it could be

anyone or anything

one

it's myself

it's yourself

that's right

go ahead and repeat out loud after me

and you can change any of my words to

make them perfect for you

and say grim reaper

are you

me

grim reaper are you me

yeah

say

why did you dress up like that

why did you dress up like that

i didn't want you to recognize who i was

i didn't want you to recognize who i was

go ahead and say why do you believe

we're unlovable

why do you believe we're unlovable

because that's all we've experienced so

far

because it's all we've experienced thus

far

what do you feel called to do as you

look at this

statuesque grim reaper who dressed up in

this halloween costume just to try to

trick you and you got to the root of it

in one second

what do you feel called to do if

anything

hug him

yes hug him

pour love into him pour love into this

personification of your deepest fear

about yourself

and let me know what happens next

he turned to an angel and and then to

little mandy

turned into an angel

and then to little mandy

to little you that's exactly right how

does little mandy appear

relieved

she's relieved

and how old is little mandy appearing to

you there

six

yeah she's six

that's exactly right

what do you want to do is you look at

six-year-old little you

sorry

[Music]

rescue her yes you want to rescue her

mandy from the year 2021 this is not the

time to stay silent this is not the time

to stay small you let those tears come

if they want to come you express your

emotions that shared emotion that you

have with little mandy that only she can

understand the depth

of those emotions the way that you can

you are allowed to express yourself

you are allowed to be

heard and she is too

you're doing so well

and now you want to rescue her

so when i count down from three to one

and snap my fingers you're going to do

just that a scenario will play out and

you will rescue little you

you will be the hero you will save the

day you as an author have the

opportunity to rewrite your own history

right now in this moment

gather your courage

three going even deeper

gather your strength to trusting what

comes

and one

rescue little mandy now

take all the time you need rescuing

little you

and when you're complete you'll let me

know by placing both hands over your

heart

beautiful really really good

and you can choose to share

what you just did out loud if you'd like

if it feels like the most empowering

choice or if the most empowering choice

feels like to keep that sacred

you can keep it to yourself

what feels most powerful to you in this

moment

to share it

beautiful how did you rescue little

mandy

i just picked her up and held her close

and she was scared

but also felt very safe

and then i brought her to the animals

[Music]

that's right you picked her up and you

held her close even though she was

scared

she also felt safe

and then you brought her to the animals

and i was able to see that

i've chosen to stay small to protect

myself

because i didn't want to experience any

more potential pain

that's right

you were able to see that you kept

yourself small to try to protect

yourself from any more potential pain

and what do you know to be true now

it's safe to be mean

it's safe to be you

go ahead and repeat

five times out loud as you imagine

well you can say five times out loud or

10 or 15 however many you need to get to

the end

while you imagine writing your

manuscript

with little mandy's help of course

as your consultant

publishing printing having the first

edition of your book arrive at your home

holding that book hearing the sound as

you open it for the first time running

your hands over the pages

smelling the fresh book smell

repeat over and over and over again it's

safe to be me

as you write and publish your book

beginning now

it's safe to be me

it's safe to be me

it's safe to be me

it's safe to be me

it's safe to be me

it's safe

to be me

it's safe

to be me

that's right

it's safe to be you

now go ahead and take little mandy's

hand

and find that group of teenage animals

all waiting to hear your triumphant

publishing story and the journey you

went through to break down

that old personification of that old

fear because underneath the grim reaper

was a beautiful angel and a child who

just wanted to be held and loved

share the story of your journey and your

triumph

as you pass out fresh copies

of your book to everyone in that circle

well taking all the time you need and

sharing what that was like when you're

ready

it was fun

i i used to teach high school so i

enjoyed teenagers

and

they all wanted to know how they could

do that process themselves like busting

through their own fear

to pursue their dream

and that was

wonderful to be able to share that

yes

authentically

yes

they all wanted to know how to bust

through their fears

and share their dreams and it felt so

good and was so fun for you to be able

to share

how you did that authentically

beautiful job really good

excellent

so now we're going to have you imagine

one more thing

you're going to imagine into the future

when you're writing your books

and when

little mandy gets a little scared and

you can feel that she's starting to dig

out her old grim reaper costume she's

looking for it but she doesn't need it

all she needs is a hug

all she needs to remember and to hear is

that she's lovable

and all she needs to hear and be

reminded of is that it's safe to be her

so right before publication day right

before going on stages to talk about

your book in those moments where she

needs an extra boost

you're going to close your eyes

you're going to imagine that color you

love

you're going to give little mandy a hug

you're going to say

i know you're lovable because i love you

and it's safe to be you

and then you're gonna get back to work

envision doing that over and over and

over again until you know you've got it

close your eyes

you say green or whatever color is

coming to you that day you give little

mandy a hug

tell her i know you're lovable because i

love you

it's safe to be you

and then you get back to work

do that now until

you've seared it into your body mind and

spirit

beautiful

how do you feel now

really relaxed

and

um

light free

yes you feel really relaxed

light

and

free

every day in every way

your courage increases more and more

every day in every way you remember your

books

help your readers to feel peace

and joy

every day in every way you feel more and

more lovable because every day you

remind little mandy how much you love

her

and that reverberates throughout time

and space and then you get to receive

that self-love proclamation in the

present moment

so you pour love into little mandy as

often as you can

receiving that love

and channeling it into your work

it is safe for you to share your truth

you amplify and magnify your courage to

do so

staying small

in order to stay safe

is an old outdated unhelpful mechanism

from the past

you blow it a kiss goodbye

and keep marching forward

perfect

into the life of your dreams

excellent top

if there's anything else you'd like to

say to your animal friends to little

mandy go ahead and do that now

when you're feeling complete and ready

to come back you'll say out loud i did

it

i'm so proud of myself

i'm ready to come back now

i'm ready to come back now

perfect

go ahead and say the whole phrase

i did it

i'm so proud of myself

i'm ready to come back now

i did it

i'm so proud of myself

and i'm ready to come back now

that's exactly right

you did it

you're so proud of yourself

and you're ready to come back now

one moving your feet in your toes

two moving your hands and your fingers

three lots of energy returning to your

body

four coming back to this place this time

five remembering everything six feeling

proud of yourself seven filled with love

for yourself eight feeling great

nine getting ready to open your eyes and

ten

[Music]

opening your eyes returning back

wipe the eyes

thank you

oh my goodness beautiful job my absolute

pleasure

thank you

that was an ugly block grace literally

an ugly block

wow the grim reaper did that surprise

you yes

like but it to me it was like symbolize

the the my own

block being the death of my dreams

sorry

yes it's perfect isn't that amazing the

wisdom of the subconscious yes you

didn't consciously choose that

this image pops up that literally

represents the death

of your dreams and there's little mandy

hiding underneath these cloaks

um yeah yes like

knock knock let me out

amazing so i have a couple questions for

you and then i'm just gonna let you bask

in the glory of your transformation

because

as powerful as the hypnotherapy session

is

it's it's really kind of well there's a

couple ways you can think about it you

could think about it as tonight we

planted seeds

and over the next couple of days they're

going to grow roots and sprout through

the ground and you're going to really

start to enjoy the benefits of the

session when the right when the fruit

blooms when the flowers bloom

in in a couple of days

but another way to think about it is we

went on a journey today now like if we

were in a car we went from point a to

point c

now begins the time where you get to get

out of the car and enjoy the destination

so first let's talk about the fact that

this was your first one-on-one session

how is this different from

the recordings if at all

um

i well i first i love the recordings

because you know you're being guided but

um

i felt like

you definitely could feel my energy and

kind of knew where to drive it

um if that makes sense or like just

maybe even the responses i was having um

it could be more directional in that

which

um

i felt like really got to the root of

things much quicker

um

yeah not that i haven't had that

experience uh on the app before but this

was on a whole new level so i loved it

yeah an app can't go that's right it's

yeah one staircase that's cool to the

touch yes

you can't go deeper into your personal

experience so powerful but generic

whereas this is completely your world

it's all your subconscious amazing so

speaking of your stone staircase is that

the staircase you typically see or was

that yes

no it's it's my tried and true i just

love it

kind of like a whimsy nerd so like i

just like that stuff um

yeah and it just it just feels natural

and very homey and

grounding so

yeah

so for the viewers at home they might

notice that at that point your eyelids

started fluttering a little bit

which is what happens in emdr right

rapid eye movement or in the rem stage

of sleep and that's an indication that

we're entering into the theta brainwave

state it's a sign of synabolism so i do

that so much every time i do hypnosis

myself when i'm the client or i'm

listening to a recording but it's it's

interesting when other people don't yes

that's a great sign

that's good that you said then i'm so

funny that the video picked it up but um

even when i'm meditating just normally

like i will get to that eye flutter i

made my own kid one time with my

daughter she was like

mom what are your eyes doing i'm like

it's it's normal honey it's normal

normal it's rem sleep cycle kind of it's

perfect

and not everybody experiences that but

those who do is perfectly normal and

natural

so today when you went to your enchanted

forest was it similar to what it was

like in the past or did anything new

stand out to you

oh i can't hear you i think i'm sorry

yeah there was a lot a lot more animals

this time

uh i think animals for me

as a kid that's kind of um

where i would escape to was anywhere in

nature or with animals because i felt at

peace and unconditionally loved and i

feel like that's what i was clearly

needing

at the bottom of my staircase today so

wow

again amazing how the subconscious gives

you exactly what you need without a

directive you didn't go i need to feel

unconditionally loved i equate

unconditional love with animals so let's

go let's face it

you just show up and it's bambi and it's

like yeah it was

and like the first thing i did was give

the little baby dear kiss like

i feel like i was in a disney movie

exactly i was right there with you i

loved everything but that's my happy

place too

so

the next thing we did is i had you

imagine the circle of animals reading

your first children's book now normally

if we had more time we did have a little

bit of a time crunch in creating this

video

i would have asked what do you want to

do what do you notice what happens next

and we would have gone down that path

and that's wonderful when it's

completely client directed but i've done

so many thousands and thousands and

thousands and thousands of sessions at

this point

for any of my students who are in my

school listening who are beginners we

don't do this but once you've got i mean

you know over 10 000 hours of practice

you can start to sense what might be a

really powerful

place to shine the lantern right but i

always ask does that resonate is it this

or is it something else so that you have

the opportunity to rewrite it as we go

along if it doesn't fit or make sense so

even if i offer a suggestion i always

leave an opportunity for you to redirect

if it doesn't fit but your face lit up

when i said there was a circle of little

animals ready to hear your story so what

was that like for you what did you feel

and what did you experience reading it

to them um

i know this sounds so weird but because

they like unconditionally love me like i

i wanted to give back that my version of

love

which is

really trying to help ease the pain and

suffering of others so bringing joy

bringing hope bringing um

information kindness whatever it is just

sharing that

with

those who are very reciprocative to me

because i will i want to share that with

anybody but it was especially rewarding

getting to share with these animals that

clearly unconditionally love me

so because they're animals they they're

great at that

amazing and the subconscious can't tell

the difference between what's real and

what's imagined so if we want to create

this powerful feedback loop where you're

receiving unconditional love and

therefore your cup is full and you're

ready to pour back out the peace and the

love and the joy and all the things that

come from your writing

we don't have to wait to actually get

that externally from the outside world

from other people who are in pain

we can just go internally and imagine

our animals filling up our cup and it's

it's actually happening as far as the

subconscious is concerned

that's so cool

that's so cool it's so cool it's so

powerful you can do it every day and

you'll have this recording obviously of

this video so you can come back and just

listen along

uh a couple more questions so

what was it like when you started crying

there was a moment where

you became overwhelmed with emotion

what was that like for you what was that

experience like through um

it just

it was like an epiphany that hit me of

of why

why i stay small why i feel my time i

mean life is just busy as it is we're

all busy but like

it's excessive and

you know definitely talking about

procrastination earlier on it just hit

me like that like duh like this is

exactly

why i'm doing that and it was because i

interrupted one second yeah awesome i'm

going to lovingly ask you to put that in

the past tense so why i used to play

small what i used to procrastinate

you're doing perfect keep going yes why

i love that and i love that you caught

that and are correcting me because

that's

how on autopilot it is right

um

so it was it was just very clear

epiphany moment and i didn't

a lot of the stuff that i went through

you know when i was young and then you

know

having cancer and an autoimmune issue

and you know divorce and bankruptcy and

i mean infidelity like all of it that

was that was

decades of

pain and i worked through it i got

through what i needed to but it was like

i don't who wants to experience any more

of that even though you know you can get

through it

but you don't necessarily want to and

and

by me putting myself out there it was

almost like

i was afraid i was i would bring on the

own pain myself if that makes sense

um and that's why i kind of like no just

stay small do you know that's the way to

keep you the safest

and an idol but it's

so dissatisfying staying in that stuck

mode when you know you're capable of so

much more

and and you are you do make

achievements and accomplishments in ways

and you are fulfilled in other ways but

there's still

just

dissatisfaction like discontentment

because something else feels like it's

controlling your life on the inside so

it just all came full circle in that

moment

and with this didn't come up in the

session if we were to do a second

session i'd probably start here

but uh this is something you can do on

your own by just going into

self-hypnosis and sort of clarifying

with your subconscious like hey all

those years you had me playing small all

that crap happened anyway

totally save me from anything buddy

that's the funny thing like we life is

life right we can't control any of it

and so it's so funny how we try and

convince ourselves that oh if we just

keep doing this or we do that we'll be

fine but that's not

that's not the case

you know when people start doing

hypnosis and they feel so much better

it doesn't stop hurricanes from

happening right the external world

continues throwing stuff at us

constantly but by doing hypnosis and

weeding out the things that don't serve

us and cultivating courage and all those

things internally we just deal with the

external things phenomenally better and

we start to live a life by design rather

than a life by default

which is so powerful and interestingly

enough little mandy didn't even need to

go to the place where she was doing this

to save other people or other kids right

the thing we talked about on the front

end and that's why like conscious

conversations are great but the

subconscious knows what it needs she

needed a hug

that's how she

needed you to is her and take her to be

with the animals she needed to know she

was lovable and she's obviously loved

you love her

yeah yeah i did and so your conscious

mind can think about all the children

and all the women and all the things

that's a great thing to kick us into

gear little mandy just needed a hug

yeah yeah

so so simple oh pure

yep

yep

so how do you feel now when you think

about writing little chicky marie

oh it's it's it's it's exciting it's i i

love it i'm like ready to work on it

tonight

how did you feel before we started if i

was like oh you need to work on little

chicky marie tonight just avoiding it

it's written it's edited it's just

i

haven't illustrated it yet

and that you know that's my excuse i

don't have time to sit in and paint you

know i don't have time to sit and

do this you know

and then it's like oh then maybe i'll

just hire an illustrator just to get it

out there and just excuse after excuse

so

this is like no like just make the time

for it like

you're pretty good at

figuring it all out anyways like you've

got this

as kyle would say yes okay you've got

this you got this we love you guys

so when you sit down to illustrate

tonight which will be the greatest gift

you can gift yourself we're doing this

pretty late at night and still carving

out the time to do some illustrating

tonight imagine little mandy's next to

you she's got her colored pencils too or

her crayons or her markers or whatever

and you're allowing her to express

herself as well

and then send me a text of what you've

done i'm so excited to celebrate with

you oh i love that thank you

well beautiful job you know i hope

everybody watching really and i think

that they will gets the sense that when

you go into theta where that critical

mind is gone

and you're connected to your intuition

and your inspiration you're able to

overcome a lifelong

challenge rapidly and of course the

proof is in the pudding and it's an

average of six sessions to see 93

improvement but it's only an average of

six i feel like you made way more than

15 to 20 improvement tonight if you had

to give it a percentage of leap forward

what would what number would you give it

i'd probably say like at least at least

30. like i feel like there was a good

like just that epiphany moment where i

was like oh

oh like that that did a lot for me and

so if that if it was a leap of 30

forward that's another two three

sessions max to get a hundred percent of

the way there and your life has forever

changed it's it's so powerful so thank

you for being so vulnerable

for

sharing yourself and your story and your

journey with me and with everybody

watching tonight it's it's been an honor

to be your guide

in the enchanted forest see it was

fitting

yes oh thank you so much for walking me

through all that and for showing

everybody um how interactive and easy it

really is uh to see some some pretty

cool things uh even if it's not the grim

reaper they'll probably have a really

cool experience

as cool and as perfect as that one
