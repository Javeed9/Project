so we're here today to talk about CBT

and your experiences of it how did you

feel initially about the thought of

going for CBT my clinical psychologist

has told me that I needed to see someone

I thought I didn't need to see someone

because there was nothing wrong with me

I just had a heart disease and I my

heart disease had got so severe and I

was just tired and there was no one that

could make it better by listening to me

you're talking to me the only thing I

thought that could heal me was heart

surgery and when he suggested that I see

someone it didn't seem to make sense but

because I was so depressed so far gone I

my husband through my husband I thought

are trying just take a chance and just

listen to someone or let someone listen

to me because I wasn't sure what it

entailed I've never been to a clinical

psychologist before so to me as a

clinical psychologist was a shrink you

must have had something seriously wrong

with your brain that she needed to see a

clinical psychologist and I didn't need

to see one but when I did meet her and I

realized that not being able to make up

my mind about going for surgery for

heart surgery and putting my name down

on the list I needed someone to help me

accept it in order to get surgery done

because I didn't want to get surgery

done and she listens to me and to the

way I felt and what was making me hell

hold back on surgery and what made me

feel the way I did and finally enough as

a woman you tend to feel that you can't

cry on someone else's shoulder but for

the first time just letting my emotions

out to her she helped me cry and by me

speaking to her it helped me see myself

from the inside if that makes sense I

then I began to understand why I had to

get heart surgery done it wasn't because

I was tired but I had my family and

everyone that went through the road with

me of suffering with Matt said you need

to get it done and then eventually I did

my name down on the list not knowing it

would be done so quick because I

supposed it was supposed to take me six

to eight months to get heart surgery

done but when I started seeing my

clinical psychology I understood it I

put my name down and I got my surgery

done in 30 days time so it sound then

like part of their clinical

psychologists role with you is to help

you to make your decision around whether

to get surgery or not yes but you also

said that you were quite depressed at

the time was the CBT helpful for your

depression as well it helped because

then instead of crying and holding

things back emotionally it helped me let

things out and by letting things out it

helped me understand what I was feeling

because most of the time we bottle

things up we never let them out - or we

never talk to each other or other people

so when we bottle stuff up it makes it

harder for us to figure out ways to

solve problems sometimes it can be a

little problem and we turn it into a big

problem because we just don't

communicate with other people or talk

things over to make it easier to

understand and she helped me understand

and I saw her before surgery right

through my heart surgery and after heart

surgery and she helped me by then by the

time I started doing heart surgery I had

lost my self-confidence I was so

depressed I was so withdrawn but after I

had heart surgery and I carried on

seeing her she helped me gain my

confidence back again

she helped me gain my trust again she

helped me see that there was something

worth loving for again and in lots of

times when I think of the things that

dr. penny did for me it brings tears to

my eyes and makes my heart well up

because um I didn't know another person

could do that for you

by just listening to you you know like

when we go to mom when you got a problem

and you think no one can understand but

my mom can because she knows where I'm

coming from but it's not to say that

clinical psychologists are like that but

it's just the way they listen to you

just having that someone that can listen

to you and just be the MP stop be quiet

and let you express yourself that's how

and help you find out what the problems

are that you've got and help you solve

those problems if they can was there

anything about the CBT in particular

that you found was helpful for you dr.

penny was neat with me every step of the

way with all the problems that I had

she helped me show me that there's an

easier way to solve everything and not

make a big problem out of everything

there's always someone every step of the

way that stayed too healthy if you need

a helping hand and that's how I in by

the time I had finished therapy with her

I found out that clinical psychologists

are not just drinks they are people like

us and they do feel like us and it's so

much easier to speak to someone when

you're having problems because we also

do in our lifetime break down sooner or

later it you don't have to be mentally

ill you can be in a car accident any any

problems in the home it's something you

can't even have a death in the family

that you can break down with and you

need somebody just to hear you how you

feeling because we all assume that

somebody else naturally knows what I'm

feeling or thinking but it's not that

way we all different were there any

drawbacks to going for CBT in the

beginning I didn't I didn't have any

drawbacks going for CBT because I was so

severely depressed I needed it and I

found that there were people all around

that would help me so there was nothing

the only see the raw stopping me was me

so it sounds like it was a good

experience yes have you got any advice

that you would want to offer anyone who

is thinking now about going for CBT yes

don't look at the word CBT but look at

the person behind it because sometimes

we see big words and we don't understand

the meaning of those words and we assume

but sometimes when we look behind

would like clinical psychologist I would

have said a shrink and I would never

have thought myself going to one because

they deal with mental people but it's

not that is you can help suffer from

depression you can suffer from any kind

of illness and it's so good to go to a

clinical psychologist when you need them

because one sooner or later in our lives

we will need one and most people when

you know like when you find younger

people that are nowadays lots of young

people are going under so much stress in

life if you haven't got a parent or a

friend and you're suffering from

depression those are the right people to

speak to because it's good to be able to

have someone in your life that you can

talk to

cuz I know there's no one in my family

that I can talk to I always think my

husband would never understand me my

kids would never understand me but when

I go to the doctor he never has that

enough time for me but with the clinical

psychologist they make that time for you

and they listen to you you've got you've

got that time with them to express

yourselves and you still got follow-ups

and they can check on you and make sure

everything's all right if you not

everything's not all right they can

always check and find ways and means to

help you get you in touch with other

people that can help you or get in touch

with other people that are the same

having the suffering from the same

conditions as you and you can swap ideas

with each other to find and live a

happier life
