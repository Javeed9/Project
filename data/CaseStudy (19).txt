When someone hears the phrase 'multiple personalities' it likely stirs up images from the

1976 movie Sybil, or perhaps the opposing characters of Jekyll and Hyde.

Popular culture would have you believe that people with multiple personalities are dangerous, and few and far between.

however an estimated 150 million people experience dissociative disorders

What is it like to live with multiple people in one body?

Today, you'll meet two people, Encina diagnosed eight years ago with dissociative identity disorder who has

11 personalities and you'll meet Minnie, the three-year-old girl who lives inside Encina's body

Alright, Encina, tell us where you're from.

So, I was born in California and lived there until I was around five years old and my

family moved to Arizona, and I've been there ever since.

And you have a unique diagnosis of having dissociative identity disorder?

A lot of people know that as multiple personality disorder. When were you diagnosed with it?

I was diagnosed; I think I was about-- it was like 22 or 23.

Okay. and what led to the actual diagnosis?

I started having a lot of amnesia feelings which a lot of people are, you know, they

They could think of as a normal thing. You know, you forget what you have for breakfast the day before

And it just became so big that things were happening

it's really hard to explain until you're actually like kind of going through it

That I was seeing therapists regularly and

And Uh

It it was just a diagnosis that ended up happening.

So you're having these events in your life. Where you Monday morning? Wake up and you can't remember what you did over the weekend. And

Wednesday at night you're going to bed and you're thinking what did I do this morning? What did I have to eat?

And you don't think too much of it because people forget stuff but then after 20 to 23 years of this

You're seeing a therapist and finally the therapist says look you have dissociative identity disorder

Yes, but I've been seeing therapists even before then, but it ended up coming out. Yeah. Yeah, that's what it was and

when you you're Encina talking to me right now, yes, but you have

Eleven other alters that you can go into.

Can you tell me about each one of those? Oh

So I can tell you about

Basically I have five primary alters

which are the ones that I--

You know if I'm gonna switch I switch into them very regularly

Um, and

uhh

I have one that, I usually,

in the past

I would switch into almost every single day every day

-every day? -every single day.

And how long did you switch into her, that person?

So, she would come out, uh,

For hours at a time, and sometimes for days at a time -but did this go on for months, years, days?

This was like years. Absolutely, Yeah.  -So, let's talk about her.

Okay, so, It's gonna sound kind of weird. So basically

Let me start from the beginning a little bit. So,

People with DID, they get it by having

Traumatic

reoccurring childhood experiences that were just like

unavoidable and it's repetitive usually so it's a lot of like, you know, just different kinds of

harming things that are happening to these people that are just

Super traumatic and you're saying from your understanding

It's not just something that occurs once but something that's occurring getting more regularly.  -Yeah, it's absolutely more repetitive. It's stuff

That's absolutely reoccurring

and

people with DID they get it around the ages of like

Newborn to around six to seven years old so you can't get DID after that time

so

To kind of describe it

Everybody starts out with multiple personalities if you can kind of imagine that and then as you get older,

you know, your personalities come into one person if you've

experienced trauma

Reoccurring trauma as a child, you know, usually before that age those ages

Your personalities stay split and as a child

These traumatic experiences are going to create these different personalities and these different

'alters' if you will, and

Basically

They're what you're taking from around you so some people will have alters that are like animals

some people will have alters that are completely

like

nonliving things like rocks

Which sounds very odd?

But it's it's what you know as a child what can protect you and those alters become your protectors

so it's not a

bad thing that they're there

Do you want to talk about what happened in your childhood that caused you to develop DID?

So, I don't remember the majority of my life up until like around six years old.

I have like very small little clips, I guess but like only a couple of them.

But I know that it was a

sexual abuse thing and it did happen with

My father along with like some of his friends.

And you know this happened, but for the most part you can't remember it so

It wasn't up until I started seeing my therapist and I started like becoming more

aware of my alters and knowing they were

So when my when I first started understanding that I had DID

obviously your first

Thought and first want to do is to fight against it. I don't want this. I don't want multiple personalities

You know, it's not a good thing like you want to get rid of them

You can't get rid of DID. You can never even get rid of an alter. They're always going to be there

when the so these things happen to you when you were a kid and

Then through your teens and early 20s, you were experiencing symptoms of DID, but it was undiagnosed

Mhm

And then you went to therapy and got diagnosed with DID and you total have eleven

Alters five of which are primary, but one used to come out every day. Let's start with her

Okay, so she is her name is Minnie and she's a three year old girl

And that's one of your alters. She's one of my alters now, is she you?

When you were three

No

So she she was like the first one the next one that ended up coming out

Was Devin and Devin is Minnie's?

Caretaker if you will so if there's something that is happening that a three-year-old shouldn't be seeing she'll take over instead

Devin will take over. Mhm. So Devin's a girl. Mm-hmm. Yeah, so Devin will come out. Mm-hmm

It's kind of like Minnie has DID. I feel like and he has to become Devin in order to

kind of kind of

so like if a traumatic experience is happening like the first thing in alters like

The first thing that they want to do is they want to help so what they do is they take over

So that's what they would do when I was a child, you know

If a traumatic experience was happening to me as a child

They would take over they would basically drive the body if you will kind of like a car

Are you aware that you've been taken over?

So usually I wasn't because I wasn't aware of all of that. But as

You know, I went through life and I started experiencing

Okay, I get dizzy or I get kind of like like tired and things like that. I started recognizing that okay

I'm getting ready to switch

and as I started to work with them instead of against them it became a lot easier and it became like

Okay, I'm going to switch they're just going to take over. It's not a big deal. Okay, fine. We started to

communicate with each other through a diary and

Which was the only way that I could communicate with some of them. I've never even met all of them myself. I

am Co conscious

With five of them meaning if they're out I can see what they're seeing if they decide

So they can decide to kind of block me out

if

I'm not Co conscious and I'm completely like in an amnesia state then, you know

It's usually one of the other alters or something else is happening one of the six. Yeah

When is the last time Minnie came out?

She actually

Doesn't come out as often anymore. I was in some pretty

Abusive relationships and she would come out all the time because of that

but

She hasn't been out for about a month now all month. Mm-hmm. Okay? Yeah, tell me about the last time she was out

what was the context it was just kind of playing around and

Just hanging out at the house, and she comes out and she wanted to color so she colored

She's got her own like coloring books and stuff

And how long was she out? Um

Maybe an hour

And were you co-conscious

Mhmm. Yea.

experience being Co conscious with many so

Let me let me put it like this when

When many decides to come out she kind of she does this thing where it's kind so she doesn't front fully meaning she's not taking

over the body fully

She'll kind of like peek through my eyes to see who's around and see a it's safe for her to even be herself

and if it is

She'll take over the body she fronts and she will be herself doing what she does and

If she feels kind of nervous

It's her way of holding my hand

If I'm Co conscious if I can see meaning if she gets a little too nervous then I'll just take over again

if she's completely like oh

I've got this like I'm not nervous with this person. It's okay. Sometimes she'll just block me out

And meaning like I'm kind of like an amnesia State. Hmm

Is that scary it used to be it used to be really scary because

When I go through

things like anxiety when it's like a really scary anxiety or something where I feel like very

unsafe, basically, I

Go through a lot of amnesia stuff, and I've had times where you know

I would be watching TV or something and then I'd wake up or come to and

I was like in the middle of the street somewhere else and I was like, where am I?

That doesn't happen now

But it did in the past. Why do you think it doesn't happen as much a minute? I think it's just because

Me along with my alters. They we know that we're not in a dangerous situation anymore

We're not so as your life improved or di D has improved. Yeah

Is that a common?

Is that common with people who have di D? I I believe it is

Yeah, as long as you're taking care of yourself and you're you know, seeing a therapist still at least, you know

Make sure that it's somebody who knows what di D is and how it works then absolutely, you know

Who who knew being with a supportive?

Boyfriend, you know what helped?

You are in a relationship and it is a healthy relief. Absolutely a hundred percent. Yeah that relationship you think may have helped

Curb the instances of having these alters. Come on. Oh, yeah

100% you know it you go from being in one relationship where you're terrified for your life every day

And then you go to the next one where you're just like you feel so

Safe, so content like it nothing could over bad like happen to you again when you were in those terrifying relationships

How often were your alters coming up every day every day every single day and how what percentage of those times?

were you not Co conscious you were in an amnesia state the majority of the time because I felt

very unsafe with the person that I lived with and what happens if you're just driving in a three-year-old alter so

that's why Devon is

Her protector to make sure that that kind of stuff doesn't happen

So what if Devon wants to take over and then she can she's she's 26 years old. Yeah, whew

We were in the car. Mm-hmm as encina neared right and in Devon takes over. Mm-hmm and Devon's driving

Yeah, and you get pulled over. Mm-hmm and the police officer officer says do you know I pulled you over?

and Devon says

well, we were going I was going a little fast and he says I want your driver's license and you hand it to him and

It says encina and then he says what's your name?

And you say so Devon will say encina Devon will say encina the alters. So basically the alters

Stay hidden

There's like three main rules for alters to stay hidden

Unless if they're welcome, you know unless if you know like oh this alters gonna come out

I I believe you are an alter. I know that you're not faking

I'm not just doing this as like Oh, show me a trick type of thing

To keep the past a secret

To keep it safe basically and to keep the body safe

So within those three things if they're doing those things they're doing their job

but there are people who have DID and their alters come out and

They're they're not keeping the past a secret and they're they don't care who you are. Usually when it comes to the past

That's that's why the majority of people don't realize they even have di D because they have had amnesia in the past

They don't know what happened to them in the past

They don't know why their mind is working the way that it is and why they're blacking out and why things are happening

They don't understand

Real quick. Can you list your alters and give me a two to three sentence bio-forge? Oh my god

Let's move past that no too much. Yeah, let's move past that no Mikayla, that's it. But why why is that? It's

There's so much detail with all of them

Like I so I basically in order to talk to all of them. Like I said, I have this journal they all have different

Handwriting's they all have different ideas. You have this journal. Yeah. Yeah

it's it's something that it's the only way I could communicate with them in order to actually like

understand what was happening to me because if you

think of this

as

me and

Encena I am also considered an alter

How do you know that Devan isn't the real Encena right? You know, and I'm just the one taking over right?

You know

it's a very scary thought for the person who has the ID because you never know with which like

Personality is actually the one that the belongs

Yeah, the very original is that appropriate to say the real one or the original?

The original, yeah

Because I mean because in encina's personality who I'm talking to right now could just be the one that made it to the top. Mm-hmm

Yeah, which is why does that bother you? It's not that it necessarily bothers me. It's

It's more of a thought of like

There's still so much that I don't understand about it. Is that why you don't want to go through your eleven alters they I

Think it's just because they're

They they have their own lives as well

And not all of them want to share everything about it so

Again and I don't I'm not pushing your answer. I've never even met all of them personally

Like I've only talked to some of them even just through paper

So

my I have a couple of friends who have met like all of them and

They're even a reason that I know of some of the personalities

Because because you've never met him I've just never met some of them

so can I

Think most people would will be interested in

learning about these personalities

So we we have many mm-hmm three-year-old. Mm-hmm

dominant personality comes out the most

We have Devin minis caretaker. Yeah. Now there are three more primary ones. Can you talk to us about those? So there's

Evolution of listen Evelyn. Mm-hmm

There's a Laura now all women all women you have any male alters. I don't

I

have

So I have twin alters Quinn and Quinton Quinton considers

Her himself to be kind of versatile. Oh

That's the only alter that I have that's like versatile like more gender fluid. Yes, okay

I also have an alter. That is a fairy

Like not a human. Hmm. That's a Laura a Laura. She's one of the primary five. Mm-hmm. Let's talk about a Laura

what does what does she protective so she is I

Mean, they're all gonna protect in some way or another

but she's basically like a

Very calm rational like what can we do to get things done and situated, you know, things like that. Um,

so

What does she like I know she's calm rational let's get things done

What it like how does she talk how does she sit like what he talks she talks very calm

She's like thousands of years old from what she says, you know, she's a fairy so she

I think she's she's been one of the primary ones, you know, because as a three-year-old, you know

you are trying to believe in magic and stuff and I believe that's kind of where it came from right now us as

The person you know the Fronter

I

Don't create altars if that makes any sense like I'm not like thinking

Oh, I want this kind of a person so it becomes an altar like it's just that just happened

Yeah, that's what you know. Yeah. I think that's a really important thing to understand people are gonna be watching this and thinking

Well, this girl's got blue and purple hair and she's thinks that sometimes she like is a fairy

I think that's what people are gonna think. Oh, yeah, what's the response to that the responses?

I mean

the the only thing I can do is just put out the information that I know what I've gone through my

experiences whether people believe it or not like it's

It's not gonna hurt me I know what I'm going through every single day, you know, like

So if people are going through it as well, it's nice to be able to find other

Resources that can help yeah, you know well and that's why we're doing this. Yeah, you know, it's

You know we were talking

Early on about how there are doctors and therapists and psychiatrists who think that this is not even

God not even something to be treated because it's a joke. It's silly

And not too many decades ago

that was the same response for homosexuality, you know, and so as we continue having these discussions and insight and

Doing the research

I

Think the stigma is slowly slowly removed a big stigma also is

That D ID is rare and it's not what makes you say that so if you look up the statistics

It the D ID

affects people, you know the one to two percent of the population of the human population, basically and

Bipolar disorder is 2% of the population. Mm-hmm

Like there's a lot of other disorders that are also in these small

percentages that seem small but when you really think about it that is 75 million people -

150 million people that have been diagnosed

Yes, 875 million 250 million people have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder

And Eid or an another 75 250 million

Yeah, and those are the diagnosed people. Yeah, that's just the diagnosed people

That's that's you know again, I didn't know that I had it for 20 years

Yeah, we we've talked we've done a few video segments on

Bipolar disorder and the amount of that that goes undiagnosed it was staggering

Yeah, you know people just think oh you're depressed or a lot. You have these moments of where you're just killing it for

Yeah, right, but you know, it's an actual disorder that has to be treated. Mm-hmm. Do you have any alters that are?

dangerous

No, I had an alter when I was like a teenager

That would come out

and

cause a lot of trouble again

It was me thinking that I was just a troubled person because things would be happening and I'd be like, why am I?

Yelling like this or why am I this angry?

I don't know

14 15 16 around that age

And even my mom would be like you're like a very troubled teen like what can we do for you?

But you the reason I asked how old you were. Mm-hmm

Every teenager goes through that 14 15 16 year old they get an attitude. They're yelling or screaming whatever

Yours just happened to be a symptom of something that most people would never even think. Yeah. Yeah

So my mom just thought for a long time. I was this troubled teen and

Going through the therapy and stuff we were able to

basically kind of

I'll say this in an easy way for people to understand it kind of mend her into the other alters as well

So she's not like her own singular

Angry alter anymore. She has become kind of a part of the system as a whole of the system. Mhm

So interesting how you think that terminology you used? Mmm-hmm

Well, that's why a lot of people with diid they call their system a system

They call their all of their altars in general to together. That's their system. Some people it gets so

detailed and so

Like intense because of how deep their di D goes again. Everybody's is different

but

With mine I've been able to

Make it to where I'm not struggling against it anymore. Yeah

I'm going to say something that I'm sure some people will say that's not politically correct and how could you say that but

There are those who?

Study di D dissociative identity disorder and say that it could be

the first superpower of

humans, mhm because for example the New York Times did a

story on a woman who either as herself or as one of the alters was blind and then as

an alter herself she could see so let's just say she as

herself as

Jessica will say mm-hmm could see but then as an alter was blind there have also been cases of people who said hey

I'm Kyle. I don't have diabetes

You can take my blood. They go into one of their altars

They take blood and those blood tests come back as being positive for diabetes

So if if that is true

Mm-hmm

And you can have blood that is diabetic and then not diabetic and the same human being just because something busy all busy all

Something's going on. Yeah that that's a superpower. Mm-hmm. Do you feel like it's a superpower? I

feel like people in general have like

Power if if you will, you know

You have the power to make yourself a happy and healthy person with work. Everything takes work, you know

So, I mean I don't want to say it's a superpower as in like

one of us is going to be able to fly and the other one can't but I mean

I I believe these situations is to be true as well

are you happy that you have the ID I am now because without it I would have

Traumatically experienced every single encounter

that happened to me that caused me to have the ID I would have

You know remembered it and it would have been like a this is happening to me

Basically, so my alters took over I was blocked out. It happened to them if you will and

There will be there were easier this who would say you need to go through that though, I feel like the therapists are more like

you have to

Remember the past and go through the work to heal from the past in order to heal from it

Yes, but not necessarily like you should be getting raped

That you should

Understand the past. Yes, so you can get absolutely and that's that's what happened

My alters ended up coming out and saying like what happened to me and like how it happened

So you have gone through so I've gone through the healing. I've gone through the

You know work and I'm still going through it. You know, I go through it every day problem. Yeah

So

like one of the the hardest

Instances that I I went through. Well one of the most frustrating ones when I was kind of fighting against this

was

Devon came out. I became friends with a group of people who knew of Devon and knew of my alters and such

But Devon ended up

Being in a relationship with somebody that I wasn't in a relationship with so I had to share my time with the body. I

Had to know okay Devon's gonna come out and go on her date

I'm gonna come out and have to go to school like it was a really frustrating time

Were you Co conscious mm. Not the majority of the time

So you as the body who are dating this person, mm-hmm, but unaware of it

I mean I'm aware of it because I've been told they're dating but when you're out to dinner with this person, I'm a damn

No clue. I don't we're not there. Mm-hmm. Couldn't say who the person was where you went

I don't know what I had to eat. Mm-hmm. And then you so for me also as

One of the statistics that you were talking about

I

am

very sensitive to gluten and

My alters are not

So when you if right now if you had gluten you would notice the effects

Yeah, but if you were Devin, mm-hmm all good all good Wow. Mm-hmm

Oh great, but how would you know that if you're not aware? Oh, well, sometimes you are aware

Yeah, sometimes I'm aware and like they you know

so when I when I eat specific kinds of wheat or bread like I get really tired or I kind of

Get a little loopy. Yeah, and they're fine

It does not affect them whatsoever

Eating bread eating right? Yeah

When you meet somebody

When do you tell them or do you tell them you have di D?

I don't

Tell everybody if I'm if I'm really close to somebody

Then you know, I might let them know

But for the majority of the time like I'm not just going out there and be like, hey, I'm encina

I have the ID, you know you're in a relationship. When did you tell him? I told him it?

took a couple of months, but

You know, I ended up telling him and he's never met anybody with the ID and most people have him. Yeah, so

he was very

skeptical about it like most people are and

He started to understand, you know how it was as he was spending more time with like many and stuff so he's met many and

What does he think about that? Oh, he's I mean, it's a normal thing now like he's like, okay

You know you have di D. That's fine. And so many just shows up and he

Hangs out with a three year old in an adult woman's body. Mm-hmm. Yep

People are gonna hear that. Oh, yeah. How is he doing that and how are you doing?

I mean that's just gonna be the reaction. Yeah, but you guys have made it work. Yeah

Wow, that is really fantastic

When you tell somebody, mm-hmm, I have dissociative identity disorder or multiple personality. What is the reaction

a lot of people, you know their only

Experience from it is from Hollywood

MTV yeah, things like that. So they're gonna think oh the Jekyll and Hyde thing they're gonna think oh,

are you dangerous some days and not dangerous other days, but

I

Think that's the majority of the reaction that I get is like, oh, do you do this or does this happen?

What are the questions you know questions like, you know, oh

Do you do you get really angry at times and laughs? Like where does that come from? Like? No. Yeah, it's it's

They're normal people

Yeah, so yeah, but it's they're normal people but it is not

common

Do you have someone who has 11 different personality? Mm-hmm. Some of which that you wouldn't even know you were being yeah

But right now I am talking to unseen

Yes, and if I was talking to an altar, would that altar lie to me possibly?

So there is just two chance. I'm talking to an altar

That is just saying there encina

So I'm gonna say no because I haven't seen it

But I know but I get what you're gonna be others say that absolutely get what you're saying. Yes

So there's a chance though if they don't feel safe

They're gonna pretend that they're me if they feel safe and they just are doing their thing then they'll be themselves

Do you know let's assume you are presenting a cocina

Do you know how they feel about all these cameras and lights and craziness? Yeah

Yeah, so I actually had a youtube channel like in the past

and I wanted to

make light of di D not in like I'm making fun of it, but they

Let's not take it so seriously and make everybody think that people with di D are

You know psychos right? They're gonna kill you or anything. So I

started making YouTube videos and I would have my altars come out I would have

Some videos where I would basically ask my altars questions as me and then they would respond as so I was a lot of cutting

Like of the video and you would have to wait until your altars came out to do that

Yeah, so I would have my friends help me film it and stuff. So it was a lot easier to transition into those. Can you?

Voluntarily bring out an altar if they want to come out. Yes

and only the ones that I'm like Co conscious with really

Otherwise like it's it's usually just a traumatic experience

Or some kind of like a trigger that will bring them out. So many and Devin. Mm-hmm would be

The most likely to come out if you were going to get robbed. Mm-hmm, okay

How has it affected your relationships I

Don't feel like it actually affected any of them like negatively I

have been in a lot of

abusive relationship relationships in the past

But that wasn't because of my alters it was just because these people were very abusive

and now that I'm in a very healthy relationship, it's it kinda is just

It is what it is. I guess I don't know. It's hard to kind of explain

Yeah, it's fine what was the worst experience of having diee

The worst experience would probably be

going days

Without knowing what was happening

not knowing where I have been or what I've done or anything and

Don't like tell me about that. I

Mean if you wake up, you know days later and

You're like where am I? It's a scary feeling? That's probably like I I can't

Say that one is like harder than the other necessarily. It's just it's all a very scary experience when you're

Not understanding or knowing what's happening

when people

Ask you to explain

What it's like to have DID or what? It's like to have an alter come out. How do you explain that to them?

so

One description that I could tell you maybe

Think of this think of your body as a car. Okay. You're driving your car

you're in the front seat and

You're doing your thing. So I'm driving my body, you know

imagine someone

Takes you out and throws you in the backseat

Now they're driving. You're in the backseat though

You can fight for control of the car or the body

You might not always win that fight

You can see what's happening just like you can you can, see in the car. You're just sitting in the backseat.

You can hear what's happening or what's being said

so that's kind of like as if

Minnie had come out, but she was holding my hand so I can still see I'm Co conscious. Mm-hmm

Say someone stuck a bag over my head threw me in the backseat now

I can't see where the body or the car is going. I can't see where I'm going. I can't see what's happening,

I can hear though. So it's kind of like a wall has been placed in front of my eyes

And that's another way of being Co conscious to a point, but I can't see, I can hear. Imagine someone

Let's see, someone threw you in the trunk. Okay. So you're in the trunk of this car.

You know that the car is going you can't hear what's happening. You can't see what's happening. You don't know what's happening

That is a type of amnesia that is happening to the body and then imagine somebody has

Knocked you out

thrown you in the trunk and

then

Drove around did their thing, whatever, and then put you back in the front seat before you woke up and then you woke up.

So, now maybe this car is parked in a parking lot or the body has walked somewhere.

You don't know where you've been, that's full amnesia. That last

experience is what most people think of when it comes to DID, but there's a whole level of

like different types of

switching or

Amnesia, or, you know alters coming out or not.

If that makes sense, I think that makes perfect sense. I think that will be the metaphor that people

Understand the most without having DID. Mm-hmm, but it amazes me that today,

you're happy you have it. Yeah.

I'm very thankful.

If an experience happens that like I just can't handle. I know that they have my back they're there to help me

Mmm, so it's not you know a bad thing

What type of doctors do you see and how many do you see for DID?

So, unfortunately, I still haven't been able to find a doctor who specializes in DID, in Arizona that is close to me

I have spoken to doctors who believe the ID and who are very

Reassuring when it comes to it and stuff and who will still talk to me, about it, and things you know,

like let me be me and let the alters come out and such.

But I I haven't been able to find very many that actually like

are close to me and

specialize in it. Do you take medicine for this?

I don't so there is no medication that you can take to stop switching, or to stop the DID.

You can take medications to help with whatever other kinds of diagnosis you have

So most people who have DID. They'll have you know one of their

alters will have bipolar or they'll be depressed or they'll be

They'll have like a heart condition, you know, so they'll take medications for those specific things those other mental disorders

But there's nothing that you can take for DID

Specifically, to stop it. I know you don't want to and I'm not asking you to. Mm-hmm. But why?

Why would you feel why do you feel uncomfortable?

Trying to bring Minnie or Devon out on camera

So I don't feel comfortable with that because it's it's not my choice. It's their

You know their own person as well, and if they wanted to come out they absolutely could

Minnie used to come out a lot and

She's come out with the majority of my videos and stuff that I had in the past

She's met the majority of my friends that know that I have DID

But

she's also

She has her own feelings, too.

You know, as a three year old and you have people who, you know, who were my friends who loved her, and then

You know, disappeared and then they're not there anymore. So she she has her own level of like

'Don't leave me', type of thing, if that makes any sense as a three-year-old would. Yeah. So, and none of your alters age.

Mm-hmm. So Encina gets older, which is not

always the same with everybody. Some people do have alters that age, mine don't.

If you could have all your alters lined up, mm-hmm all 11 of your personalities,

Would there be

some of them that you would love to sit down and talk to as Encina? And what would you say to them? Oh, absolutely

because me and Minnie have been so close for so long, you know, she's she's the

first alter that I know of that would come out as a protector and

She I

Can hear her voice I can see what she's doing like they have their own

World inside. Can you see what she looks like? Yeah, I can see what she looks like, everything. And what does she look like?

Silver hair and she has like a little beauty mark. She's really tiny. She's really cute, like

it's...

Hi hi

You're Minnie?

Yeah

mmm

I'm Minnie. I'm I'm three

You're three? Mm-hmm. What do you think about all these cameras?

A lot of cameras. Mm-hmm. And do you like Encina?

But because my mommy did their videos like this a long time ago, I would do those ones, too

And we have we had lots of fun. We had my my mommy's other friends would be there, and they will help out Jude with the videos

Mommy has to be out

Okay, so when mommy comes out,

then,

You go to the house and play and stuff with Devin?

Okay, cool. And so when was the last time you came out here?

Mm-hmm. I'm not come out like very many that much more. Um, but

We we can see

We can see what happened. So you can see what's going on, you just don't-

- you don't have to you don't always come out though. Yeah. Yeah and

Are there things,  do you wish you came out more? Are you happy to stay in your house?

A lot of three-year-olds are not they're much more difficult than you. Nope

yeah, I try to be some some friends, but

It's very a hard they don't look like me. hmm, what do they look like?

They is littler and because I'm in mommy it's

But you have Devin though.

Yeah and

Mommy. Mm-hmm. So they're your friends. Uh-huh. Yeah

and two cats

What's so funny I just like kitties oh

All right, so then Minnie, when you're ready to go home, how do you go home ? I guess

My mommy come out. Oh, okay. You want to go get her? Oh

Okay

How are you feeling? good, a little nervous why are you nervous? very nervous Um

Just it's it's a

Big

It's a big thing to

Let Minnie out in front of like people that I don't know. Mm-hmm

It's nice when I'm able to cuz I know that like Minnie really appreciates it because she can be herself

But it's really nerve-racking for me

Was that person were you co-conscious that whole time? Yeah. Yeah, I could see what was happening. So what was happening on your end?

Just letting her do her thing. Just letting her be her so you're just in the back and walk yeah

It's kind of like I

saw this one picture online once where it was like somebody had drawn a face and

So you see like the side of the head. It's like a view from the side and

What you can like the eyes have like a projection as if you were looking like at a movie theater and somebody was sitting like

Watching what was happening through the eyes

So that's kind of what I'm doing. I'm almost like watching like as if I'm in a movie theater. Mmm

When Minnie says that you're like her mother. Mm-hmm. How does that make you feel?

It was fine at first actually it was a way for me to kind of relate to her and that's kind of what we've

Gone with you know, she calls me Mommy and that's fine. Um, I mean, I feel like

She's my little girl in a way. Like I have to protect this little being that's inside, you know, so in a way it's fine

what do you say to the people who watch this and say oh, she's just acting I

Feel like believe what you want, that's fine like it's again, it's not gonna hurt me. I know what I experience every day. I

just I

Would tell people just keep an open mind. Mm-hmm that you know other people who have DID

It's it's possible

so

You know, it's it's a reason why a lot of people don't even come out about it

you know, I've been a part of different kinds of groups on like Facebook and stuff where

you know a wife has DID and she's like, I've never told my husband because I just can't trust that he would actually like

Be there for me, you know. Mm-hmm. So

Just be supportive of the people that you love and if they come to you about anything

Keep an open mind was what just happened to rush

In like an adrenaline way not necessarily more of like a little bit of anxiety like oh this is happening, okay

Anxiety. Yeah, for Encina. Mm-hmm. Not for Minnie. Yeah just excitement for Minnie. Mm-hmm. Yeah, what did many think of me?

No, she was fine with you. She's

Fine with most people when she comes out. She just wants people to like her. Mm-hmm

What did she think of all she liked it? She was fine

Why do you think she changed her mind?

I

think it was because we've done videos in the past and it's something that she got excited to do because you know

We would come up with like scripts for it and stuff

and

She got to play it wasn't her her way of playing and getting to be you know, with the adults and stuff

so, I mean I've taken her to like the park and she's tried playing with like little kids and

Little kids are more understanding about it. You know, they're like, oh how old are you because she's

Walking and talking like a kid. Mm-hmm. And she says three years old and they're like, oh you're a big three-year-old

They believe it, you know, but obviously the parents are gonna be like get this nutjob away from my kids, you know

So it's it's a little rough. It's it's sad because she wants friends. What is good when you have friends

um

She I mean she got to play with these kids

You know, she had her toys and she brought her toys to the park, too

and then the parents said I mean the parents kind of like looked a little bit and I

was with one of my friends who kind of talked to I'm sorry who talked to the parent and

She seemed actually kind of understanding like she wasn't like oh this is weird like I gotta get my kids away or anything but

She's a three-year-old that can't have her own friends. Other than like the adults that are around already

It's so interesting to hear you talk about her like she is another person who's sitting here

I understand you're saying that they are people. Mm-hmm

But to me, I'm like no, this is just Encina when she's acting like a three-year-old. That's how it comes off. Yeah

where

We know that this is actually a separate

Human being. Mm-hmm

Wow, that just blew my mind

I've never seen anything before like that

okay, I mean it's

It's hard to grasp it's hard to grasp just sitting here watching it. Yeah, I wasn't prepared. I didn't prepare too interview a three-year-old

Yeah, I was just sitting here going

Well, of course

I would love to meet any alters that could come

But then I was I kind of just didn't know what to talk to her about. It was a

She's three years old. Yeah

But it's also a grown woman

Infront of me mhm. Oh, yeah. I I mean I get it

I've I've met people with DID where it's

hard for me to grasp because they have their own worlds and their own minds and their own personalities and some of them are

Like

wolves or

Like different like creatures and stuff that are mythological and stuff and for me, I'm like, oh, okay

How do I act in front of this other being or creature like yeah this wolf. Yeah

Well, I'm just sitting across from an adult. Yeah, yeah

Well, well, thank you for being so vulnerable of course and bringing Minnie out. I'm sure she's gonna be the star of YouTube

She'll appreciate that

Thank you for doing now of course the course

What?

Do you wish everyone knew about people with DID? I

wish think like

understood the

there

They're not just an alter. It's not just an alter ego. It's not something that we made up. You know, these are other

actual people hmm with their own lives

mmm, their own likes dislikes their their own taste in music their own like

Personalities in general they they all look different. They just share one body

hmm

so it's

I wish I could

explain to everybody how

these people aren't dangerous people with DID are

Usually the people to have stuff happen to them. They're not the ones that are gonna turn into like psycho killers. Mm-hmm

That's a good point

There's something traumatic has happened when they were young. Mm-hmm and

Now they have DID as the consequence of that. Mm-hmm, but now are being

Victimized in a certain way because of a stigma attached. Yeah, and they were the ones who originally attacked. Mm-hmm

Have you met anyone else with DID? I have I have and

It's been it was comforting it was really really comforting knowing that

there's others out there that are comfortable enough to

Like come out of their shell and say I have this - mm-hmm and not like keep it locked away

just the the more that people can hear about it and know that it's real, you know that there is hope you know, it's it's

It can only get better from here. Mm-hmm, you know there there can only be

More resources from here. Mm-hmm. So the more that that kind of stuff can

happen and

Come upon people. I think that's gonna be the best thing that happens. I think you're very brave for doing this

But I think you're going to help so many people who not only might be struggling with the idea

themselves but maybe know somebody who is

and I think all of us doing our part to be educated on the things that we know very little about

Is the first step on that?
