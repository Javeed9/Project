we've talked with dr romney about

narcissism before but we've never gone

this in depth welcome to the med circle

series narcissistic personality disorder

the second hand smoke of mental health

you were one of

the first people to ever come on med

circle

you have made such a huge impact i'm so

glad yeah millions of people are getting

lots of emails i'm so happy because it's

helping people understand this and sort

of remove some of the responsibility

from themselves and and come up with a

realistic game plan which is so

important that's why i'm in this i'm

going to help people almost like help

people save themselves and move into a

far more bright future yes yeah we did

one video on this topic i don't even

know how long it was like 10 minutes

something like that and now we're

dedicating an entire series to the i

think it's good because i think that's

going to help a lot of people have a lot

of questions and i'm hoping we'll be

able to dispel some of that yeah and

create some more understanding before i

sat down with you the first time i did

not know that narcissism

was a personality disorder

narcissism is actually not a personality

see and that's already one of the big

misconceptions out there and why people

get their sort of themselves all up in a

froth is narcissism is a pattern

i don't know that i call it a trait as

much as a collection of patterns or

traits

narcissistic personality disorder

is a disorder and if you look at

existing and epidemiological studies

one to three percent maybe mostly

because these folks don't get into

treatment because they don't think

there's anything wrong with them right

so it's very difficult to get meaningful

statistics on what the true rates of

narcissistic personality disorder in the

population

narcissism whole other game much more

endemic it's a pattern people say well

that don't label people i'm like that's

no different than saying he's agreeable

he's sweet he's funny he's narcissistic

they're patterns

the first video we did on narcissism

millions and millions of views still

even growing at the time of filming this

every day

why is this topic resonating with so

many people it's the topic of our time

there's no two ways about it it's the

topic of our time it's misunderstood and

it is absolutely

destroying people

the fact is because people don't

understand it they don't understand that

they're even in it it's almost like

you're it's like having an illness and

you don't know why you're getting more

and more tired every week and then you

finally go see a doctor and the doctor's

like oh you have da da or you're being

exposed to duda and they're like thank

you for the explanation

the number of people i have worked with

who said to me had i not come and

consulted with you clinically and

understood what this pattern was i would

have stayed living like this forever and

probably ended up in an early grave i

mean this is i think when you say that

not because they have narcissists no but

because they're living in somebody so

it's the issue of our time and here's

where it gets tricky we've actually

and we've

rewarded it in our society we're saying

like behave badly

treat people badly throw people under

the bus let's reward you behave in a way

that's uncivil and unkind and be mean

and we'll give you your own tv show

so that's what's happening you said

something to me and i don't remember if

it was on or off camera but you said

the book on

narcissism

could be titled how to be a man in

today's world and succeed yeah

absolutely and it would be the same

exactly it would be the same it would

take a rule book i actually had a

student once come to me after class and

say you know i'm trying to succeed in

business and after learning about

narcissism i now realize that if i

do all these things i'll be really good

at sales can you teach me i was like no

wait teach him how to be a narcissist

yeah i know that no okay but just for

fun can you teach someone how to play

not really i'll be frank with you i'd be

doing a lot better financially faster a

bit more narcissistic in fact and

they'll make so much money oh they do

the research is actually quite clear

a trick called agreeableness which is

actually quite opposite to narcissism

people who are agreeable are friendly

warm open gregarious helpful to other

people they make significantly less

income than people who are more

antagonistic and narcissistic yeah i

mean it costs you think about it you

know like oh no that's okay you don't

need to pay me for that

you know that kind of thing

you're like the doctor who takes your

payment in pies rather than money you

know it's like that kind of just a nice

thank you we'll do i will take a cherry

pie from time to time

you're not a narcissist uh what

can you still though

be strict and successful and aggressive

and

and make a ton of money and all these

things without being a narcissist

i'm not sure

even that answer is a really

strong answer you're not yeah i'm not

sure i haven't seen much evidence of it

i've seen some people really really make

it but even they'll acknowledge

i had to play a little bit of hardball i

had to put my needs way ahead of someone

else and not stop to think how this may

hurt them i mean there was definitely a

relative empathy deficit compared to

a far more agreeable person i just don't

say business by and large is a zero-sum

game yes and i think when you're working

in a corporate structure and you're

having to answer to folks like

shareholders and there's they don't care

about sort of the rank and file employee

that that's when the game changed i

still think when you had company towns

and the guy who ran the factory still

knew of the lives of the others there

was a bit more empathy that's kind of

gone you throw in other societal trends

like social media where it's all about

you know who can sort of social

comparison who can look better that kind

of thing it becomes more superficial i

think all of that is colluding that we

don't value empathy anymore we really in

fact especially in boys and men we're

not teaching our boys to be empathic

we're actually saying empathy is a

weakness in boys and men and that's

really one place where we can really see

a correction if we could do that but

we're actually going in the opposite

direction i mean empathy has really kind

of gone the way of the eight track like

not cool not hip

you said one to three percent of the

population has been diagnosed with

nurses yeah that's what the research

studies show and you know what i think

we get caught up in like people say it's

my boyfriend it's my husband it's my

wife when you really open that net to

mothers and fathers brothers and sisters

bosses and co-workers aunts uncles you

name it you'll see i actually don't know

a single human being whose life hasn't

really been touched by pathological

narcissism what's interesting is that

for some people it comes late in life so

they had great parents nice husband good

friends but then their sister marries a

narcissist and that's actually worse

like when your first encounter of it is

when you're a full-blown adult because

then you really don't know what to do

it's like trying to learn to speak

french when you're 50. like good luck

with that yeah you know so whereas

others of us who've started early in

this training in fact in this new book

i'm writing i say who was your first

narcissist for some people was mom like

you met her on day one for some folks

versus narcissistic because there's

going to be he's always the first wow

for people who don't know who you are

why should they listen to you when it

comes to narcissism you know

they should listen to me because

actually my way of coming into this area

was through multiple pathways the

research in my lab at california state

university of los angeles we focused on

personality disorders there and

narcissism was the one pattern where we

saw it but wasn't behaving in a

consistent manner but at the same time

in my private practice

i was astounded at the number of people

who were coming in and literally saying

the same thing and i'm like okay there's

something going on here and i really did

dug into it and said these these

partners of them they're all

narcissistic people these people are so

frustrated they keep trying everything

their partners don't change they get up

every day thinking and hoping it'll be

different it's not it's devastating and

so then i did research into i'm like wow

this is really not very treatable than

our the the person with narcissistic

personality disorder and even the

pattern really wasn't that changeable

and that just set me into a deep kind of

deep dive into the literature i

interviewed people all over the country

in fact all over the world about their

experiences with narcissistic husbands

wives boyfriends girlfriends and then

that culminated in my second book which

is called should i stay or should i go

surviving a relationship with a

narcissist and and then it was kind of

off to the races from then i think some

things changed in our world and

narcissism became more and more and more

of a topic and i'm surprised at how many

smart people just don't get it and and

it's such a pattern i said you should

almost be reassured a lot of people say

narcissists are unpredictable i said

unpredictable they're the most

predictable person in the room we know

exactly what they'll do and they say

jekyll hyde i said jekyll hyde is kind

of predictable you know they're going to

be mean and then they're going to be

nice so that's the you know once you get

that pattern into place and you know and

you know what you're dealing with i

think our problem is we it's all about

second chances that we give them we're a

little bit too heavy-handed with the

forgiveness and i'm hoping we can sort

of help folks work navigate those waters

in a way that's healthy for them and

their families so we know what people

who are in a relationship with a

narcissist or know a narcissist will get

from this series oh yeah it's the hope

it's the education it's actionable steps

if there is a narcissist out there who

stumbles upon this video because

everybody in their life has told them

you're a narcissist and they have even a

little bit of self-awareness maybe i am

what do you think they will gain out of

this this has become the question of the

year because i get emails almost every

day from a person some of them are angry

some of them are downright threatening

and some of them are really contrite

where they're saying i'm this person and

i don't want to be this person anymore

and i've hurt people give me that person

and we might have a little hope now

here's the rub a person let's say a

lifelong narcissist they're 30 40 50

years old this is how they've always

treated people

it's a tough fix it's almost like trying

to take someone who's really sweet and

making them mean not easy to do it's the

same thing we're just trying to flip it

out in the other direction take a

narcissist and turn them into someone

who's more self-aware and kind what you

might see is that you might get some

small fixes from them but i do think it

all is not lost i think if somebody is

narcissistic and is willing to do the

hard yards and put their head down

commit with a good therapist really

commit to mindfulness every day you

might get someone that way you might get

enough of a change where their family

notices a difference they may become a

somewhat better parent they might become

a somewhat better partner i mean i think

are you ever going to make them the

sweet agreeable teddy bear probably not

i think what i see is when narcissists

do enter treatment and become self-aware

the thing that they become self-aware of

and this is where it gets painful is the

emptiness and how insecure they really

are and that is one really tough look in

the mirror that's what they're avoiding

all along that's why they're so

grandiose i don't want to see the

emptiness so when we strip away that

veil and i've worked with many clients

where we finally got to the core of the

insecurity they actually became down

like downright depressed wow and that's

what they were trying to avoid all along

so it's a it's a very complex nuanced

long-term treatment plan but listen if

you're self-aware and you're like i want

to turn this around

i think that commitment is most of the

variance that's where it's at i think

something can be done just a slow burn

dr romini describes narcissism as the

second hand smoke of mental health but

why and why is narcissism more dangerous

than just being self-confident what

exactly narcissistic personality

disorder is what is it okay all people

with narcissistic personality disorder

are obviously narcissistic okay not all

people are narcissistic may have

narcissistic personality disorder so

it's a fine point but it's an important

point since everybody's throwing this

word around these days right you know

it's not unlike other diagnoses that

have

different meaning to them this one's

sort of this is like a character

assassination right so when we talk

about narcissistic personality disorder

there's a long list of patterns and they

have to have five of the nine on that

list it has to be something we call

pervasive meaning it cuts across

situations with a variety of people in

at work at home it's not just like

they're narcissistic to only you and

they're nice to everyone in the world

tends to be pervasive but here's the rub

it has to involve what we call

social and occupational impairment and

subjective distress that's a fancy way

of saying it is messing up that person's

life they're aware it's messing up their

life and they're uncomfortable with it

and that's where you don't see as many

people with narcissistic personality

disorder so if their style of not having

empathy of being entitled of being

grandiose of being arrogant and

superficial and all that is working out

for them they're not going to walk

around saying i'm having a problem

they're not going to walk around saying

this is causing me problems so if they

don't acknowledge that piece of it then

really they're a narcissist which is

sort of a clinical term for being a jerk

and we don't get to diagnose people for

being a jerk we may not like them but

that's not a condition we diagnose we

diagnose people because they're bringing

in something that they're uncomfortable

with or that's causing them problems the

best example i can give you is let's say

somebody's been using drugs for two

years and their drug use results in duis

and other problems in their lives okay

when that happens they may themselves

say i don't have a problem with drugs

but i do have five dui's and they did

find me in the gutter and from my mom's

house so i guess mom maybe there's a

problem in narcissism

they may

they may recognize that yeah sure i got

in trouble at work and i was called out

on this and that problem and i did cheat

on my wife several times but it's

working out for me is that distressing

this is being a jerk so dr alan francis

dr francis is actually one of the

architects of this diagnosis originally

in the dsm and he he himself has come

out very clearly and said we don't get

to diagnose somebody because we don't

like them

that's not what this diagnosis is for

it's for somebody who's actually having

discomfort and distress because they're

behaving in this narcissistic manner

it's a fine point but it's an important

point and here at med circle i really

want to be careful as we use these two

terms because i think a lot of the

listeners don't know if their friend

family member or boss has the diagnosis

and may never find out unless that

person that other person gets into

treatment

and their friend family member boss

might just be a jerk there might be a

jerk and they may say why should i go

get a diagnosis there's nothing wrong

with me and if they're walking around

saying there's nothing wrong with me and

i'm fine then according to the dsm

they're not they're not

they're not an art they don't have mpd

no that's it and so and that's where

people get upset i get emails every day

will you talk to my husband and tell him

he has narcissistic personalities for

i'm like no

please do not please i would love to do

that no win there so that's a lot of the

struggle here is that and you know what

the pattern of narcissism it's awful

they may be fine with it but you as the

recipient of that pattern it's not it's

you you're going to struggle with it

it's uncomfortable it's one of those

patterns that's really unhealthy for the

people around it i call it the

second-hand smoke of psychiatry like

being near a person who's narcissistic

it's as unhealthy as doing it yourself

whoa

that is a great metaphor

npd is the second hand smoke of

psychiatry and i'd say narcissism is the

second hand smoke of our time of our

time you stand close enough to it you're

gonna get sick even that's a huge deal

for people because

somebody might not get the diagnosis

yeah but there's still have all these

toxic behaviors that are affecting oh

absolutely and you know what in some

ways the diagnosis is irrelevant because

all is all that's doing is saying the

person's having problems because of it

but if they're

lying manipulating exploiting

raging at you who cares if they have a

diagnosis that's not good for you to be

in the presence of and then it takes us

back to that more critical issues why

are people like this or like this

because they're insecure and that makes

people feel guilty well

if he's insecure and this is why he's

doing this and that's what we're gonna

have to get to the core of

when does normal

self-confidence cross the line into

grandiosity

self-confidence is a healthy

state and people who are self-confident

don't need to blast their achievements

from every rooftop and every social

media platform people who are truly

self-confident don't need to talk over

other people and their achievement

people who are self-confident don't

require their achievements to be front

and center and ahead of everybody else's

people who are self-confident are so

confident in their sense of self and

their achievements that they actually

can stay quiet about it

in another video in this series we'll

talk about the different types of nurse

npd yeah but i'll give everyone a

preview from the original video we did

the communal narcissist the communal

narcissist when you said it's that

person who goes and volunteers on a

saturday but takes selfies the whole

time and a full perfect face of makeup i

go oh

i so know that person you know and it's

also the person who you say like let's

throw a gala and you're like but the gal

is going to cost 10 000 and you're only

going to make 500 for the charity why

not just write the full 10 000 for the

the charity like but i need the gala

they need gallows they need catalyst

they need parties they need celebrations

and you know what i'm smiling when you

say that because uh i think smiling is

one of my coping mechanisms by the way

like laughter and smiling because these

are very deep and heavy topics and

they're

affecting a lot of the everybody who's

in a relationship with a narcissist

which is almost everybody which is

almost everywhere and in a lot of cases

there are narcissists or in people with

mpd who

who are suffering

they well i think if you want to get

down to the core of it they are

suffering because they're deeply

insecure yeah and that's where you know

i mean but do they experience it as

suffering i'll tell you this like i said

with the people with npd or narcissism

where we start peeling back the layers

by the time you get down to layer 10 and

you start looking in the gaping hole

it's not comfortable for them and you do

it your heart does ache for them because

there's such there's almost a childlike

emptiness to them i'm not saying i'd

want to be in a relationship with them

though i can tell you that right now i

mean i can handle it for an hour at a

time but my god for a person who

actually has to live with that day in

and day out it's a nightmare are there

common co-occurring disorders

with people with mpd people who have

narcissistic personality disorder or

even narcissistic traits there are

several co-occurring patterns we can see

that are more likely to happen all forms

of substance use disorders you know a

lot of times it's to fill the emptiness

or to enhance the grandiosity so alcohol

use

cocaine use you know a stimulant use

that kind of thing so you'll see some of

that um depression

interestingly narcissism and depression

can hang out together a lot of it is

that insecurity and that emptiness it's

not unusual to see those two kind of

hanging out together but are they

getting diagnosed with depression

sometimes they're getting diagnosed with

depression because they might be very

irritable we'll see that in men

what will happen is

you'll sometimes confuse the two as well

because the type of narcissism we're

going to be talking about today is

called covert narcissism people who are

covert narcissists they're a little bit

like eeyore from winnie the pooh it's

like woe is me

no one understands me how come the world

is so unfair to me and they seem so

downtrodden that they look depressed and

then all of us will treat them as though

they're depressed and we're making

absolutely no headway and then one day

you your dawn's on you're like oh this

isn't depression at all so actually

quite frankly we'll often treat the

depress we'll think they're depressed

before we'll think they're but wrongly

so but wrongly so yeah again just

highlighting how important is to get the

right diagnosis it really is because

these personality patterns also make

treating other mental health conditions

for example it's not unusual for

narcissism to also be found coexisting

with bipolar disorder which is also a

very messy kind of uh issue to treat

because the grandiosity of the mania and

the grandiosity of the narcissism often

collides so you'll see that too and i

when i've worked with families of um

when they have adult children who are

substance abusers and the the adult

child goes into rehab

i'll also know that adult child has

narcissism and i'll i'll be i'll ache

for them because they're thinking their

child is going to go to rehab not only

come out sober but sweet they come out

sober but they're still as irritable

invalidating sort of mean as they always

were that part's not going to go away

that's the narcissism maybe even more so

even more so and you see this a lot in

substance abuse treatment circles that

you see a lot of it yes exactly because

the the substance use was sort of

helping them kind of shore up their

defenses and so it can make treatment

much much more complicated you'll also

see more a greater likelihood for

example like patterns that are sometimes

labeled love and sex addiction kinds of

like compulsive sexuality compulsive

like relationship patterns you'll see

that it coexisting with narcissism as

well it just makes everything that much

harder to treat

yes that's what it is because you don't

tend to get as much emotion there's a

lot more defensiveness i know more than

the doctor there is a lack of empathy

there's a lot of projection all this

stuff really makes it hard to do really

deep psychotherapy with somebody

how many different types of npd are

there well there's there's different

kinds of narcissism whether those

translate into subtypes of narcissistic

personality disorder i once said there's

nine possible symptoms of narcissistic

personality disorder which means there's

thousands and thousands of possible

combinations right but if we were really

to look at in five patterns that i've

sort of broken down in my book and this

is based on the theoretical work on

narcissism drawing from other people's

work when we talk about the types of

narcissism they're not really subtypes

of narcissistic personality disorder but

there are different kinds of patterns we

see of narcissism and i think it's

important to see the differences because

it shows us this doesn't look the same

across everyone and then some people say

well that's not narcissism the person i

know acts like this and i'll say ah but

it's a similar pattern let's get down to

the brass tacks of what all narcissists

look like in all narcissism we tend to

see a lack of empathy

grandiosity

entitlement superficiality

chronic seeking of validation outside of

them

uh arrogance and a real tendency towards

rage as well as a tendency to manipulate

or exploit other people those you tend

to see across the board

to varying degrees

so let's start at the top with what i

considered the most severe and

problematic narcissistic pattern and

that's the malignant or the toxic

narcissist

these are the folks that almost look

like psychopaths they are they'll

exploit other people they take advantage

of other people they lie they cheat they

they work the system to their advantage

they can often be quite successful

you might wonder why am i not calling

them psychopaths they can sometimes feel

remorse for what they're doing they're

like this isn't cool but i just got i

just got to get this part done and i'll

make it right whereas the psychopath

wouldn't need to make it right so

there's just a really manipulative

mean-spirited edge to them that can be

very unsettling but but when you first

meet them they're extraordinarily

charming extraordinarily charismatic

confident successful so that's sort of

your malignant toxic type you'll often

see these folks running big companies

you know

at the heads of government all of that

like they have they really not a working

system wow the next in the in the group

is what i call sort of your classical

grandiose narcissist and that's what

most of us think of the person who's

braggy who really is entitled i'm

special i deserve special treatment it's

almost like your celebrity narcissist

that's what your grandiose narcissist

they brag a lot they show off a lot look

at my new car look at my new this look

at my new girlfriend it's a lot of show

and tell they suck all the oxygen out of

the room all the usual traits but they

don't tend to be as exploitative and as

mean as the malignant narcissists but

they are sort of your classical

kind of narcissist the next narcissist

on the list and this is probably the

most mysterious one and maybe the most

revealing to med circle listeners is the

covert or vulnerable narcissist these

are the woe is me narcissists you know

if the world could see how great i am

i'd be one of the great ones but nobody

gets me because i'm ahead of my time and

so they'll you'll often find them sort

of at home huddled over their computer

being like a troll or like coming up

with their next big plan but they almost

have a failure to launch a lot of the

time they can often look depressed

there's a real they seem vulnerable

because they almost feel like the world

doesn't get them they're hyper

hypersensitive to criticism

um there but they lack empathy and they

can be very entitled like i deserve

special treatment because you know the

world doesn't know this but i'm the best

what's interesting about that is i

listen to that and i

when you would first meet somebody like

that you think oh they just have low

self-esteem yeah bingo but all

narcissists have low self-esteem right

that's why they're doing that exactly so

the covert narcissists they lead with

that but it looks like it's almost like

they they feel like they're they have

this sort of strange i always say that

the covert narcissist has this sort of

weird pause they'll say

yeah

i went to that college but i guess

nobody cares

and they'll do that weird thing you're

like okay well it's a little bit of

strange pause but it's a they're like

yeah i i already read that book but why

would you care

you know it's like one of those

wow

there's there's an edge it's almost like

you're sticking your hand into a bucket

of barbed wire it doesn't feel good it's

like even with those examples even

though they were just you know like yeah

random examples i still feel the pain

for that person oh they're they're they

feel the world pass them by yeah but i

don't feel the same way with a grandiose

narcissist as much

the covert narcissist ultimately will

get to the point where they feel the

world owes them something

the world owes me and there'll be a real

edge to them you know because they but

it is they seem really sad and you'll

often try to help them and you'll wonder

why they're so ungrateful

that's why that can feel really

uncomfortable for other people who are

so sympathetic to them and wonder why

are they not ever saying thank you or

recognizing all we did yeah now number

four is the communal narcissist the

communal narcissist can be very

confusing because they're out there

volunteering and flying all over the

world and doing their own personal

rescue missions and you know after every

hurricane they're posting online

hurricane goals hashtag hurricane goals

and like let's all raise enough money

and let's send lots of stuff down to the

hashtag they're the hashtag narcissist

but like it's all about their their

goals for helping the world and and like

you'll see them i mean you're not you

know about animal rescue people like

they're always holding their rescue dogs

but then they go home and they're really

mean to their husband yeah and they love

going to galas and they want buildings

named after them and if they do give a

donation they have to hold 20 gold

shovels and have lots of pictures taken

like it's all about the they do all

these things to get validation that's

their tool for getting validation are

often really unkind to the people that

their fa their immediate family or the

people who work under them they can be

absolutely awful to them and people say

oh my gosh you're so lucky you work with

him he's so charitable and the people

are just like oh no this is that's one

of many characteristics he is so so the

communal narcissist is a very it's a it

takes a while to sort of on to peel off

that layer and then to sort of that's

why i always say pay attention to how a

person treats the person who don't have

as much power as them in that situation

because that's going to teach you a lot

so they'll be really sweet to the

recipient of the charitable dollars but

really mean to the person who's working

with them and that doesn't add up the

last narcissist is sort of kind of a

good nature i'm going to call them the

benign narcissist the benign narcissist

is like this sort of clueless

uninsightful person who just says really

vapid things

very superficial

only cares like all i want is like a

fast car and you know you're driving a

piece of junk like they'll be like

dismissive other people that sounds like

every 16 year old i've ever met in many

ways if there's an adolescence there's

an immaturity but they really aren't

that mean-spirited and you can actually

kind of say that's not a nice thing to

say they're like well yeah i guess so

but then they'll go back and say it the

next day i always say it's nice to have

a few benign narcissists on deck because

they're fun to have at a party you know

like just keep them on that list but

never turn to them at a time of need

just because i'm curious and i get to

ask questions which

you know somebody put me in charge to do

this

who would you most want to be in a

relationship with those

those are your five oh mama you know and

and just solitude and the cabin isn't

because i'm gonna take if solitude in

the cabin is my option i'm going with

that one okay so it's not an option i

prefer i don't think any of those are

good

you have to choose one you have to

choose you have to choose one i might

choose the communal narcissist and

just be glad they're doing nice things

for other people

they're nice to me yeah but i i have to

tell you that can be exhausting because

when the whole world is saying you're so

lucky

he's so charitable like oh my gosh she

hasn't said something nice to me in 15

years

they're all painful maybe the benign one

but even that you feel like you're

forever in a relationship with your high

school boyfriend right that's not nice

right so i if you're if you're if like

if the cabin by myself for the rest of

my life is it's a possibility i'm going

communal i get it with therapy i can

have a cabin from you like two acres

away yeah and then we can just meet when

we want to hang out i don't recommend

any of these types for a relationship

well what about my idea for i'll have a

cabin one acre away from yours yeah that

will do that okay because you were

shaking your head no no no no no no no

you might be a narcissist so we have to

be that's true

after my before

if you don't know what we're talking

about go see the previous episode okay

uh out of those five types is there one

that's most common i would have to say

probably the grandiose the classical

narcissist okay yeah so that's why it's

classical because that's yeah

okay um

what am i not asking you about

narcissistic personality disorder as it

is defined from understanding it that i

need to be asking you know all the all

the patterns i gave you are what are

what you see of the nine characteristics

that a diagnostic manual like the dsm

would require what's really interesting

is that our diagnostic manuals are now

taking sort of a new direction in how we

think about these personality patterns

and in the most i mean not to make 2 2

kind of bookish a point on it but the

dsm now views narcissism and all of the

personality disorders through a new kind

of a lens and it looks at for example

how a person

views their own identity and the

narcissist identity is very much caught

up in how they're viewed by other people

so they don't have a core sense of self

their sense of self is governed entirely

by the world outside of them that's

actually a terrifying feeling like the

only way i'm good is if everyone tells

me i'm good today that's very unstable

we also look at goal setting how do they

how do they set their goals and

narcissists set their goal in a way

that will get them approval from the

world so either they set their goals

unrealistically high so they can talk

about the big goals they have which

they're never going to meet or they set

their goals a little too low so they

know they're always going to surpass

them

so but no matter what their goal setting

once again is based on how they can talk

to the world about these things

then when we look at other areas we look

at empathy and their lack thereof so now

dsm is looking at this across all

personality patterns and people with

narcissism don't have empathy they look

at people as existing to serve their

needs what can you do for me and then

i'll make a relationship with you so

that's why a lot of people say but that

narcissistic guy was really nice to me

i'm like yeah because he needed you as a

sales contact you're like oh or they

like the fact that you live in the right

neighborhood in town there's a need

being served and then finally

dsm is looking at narcissism through the

lens of intimacy and that's one thing

that narcissists are not good at they're

not good at intimacy they're not good at

close relationships by and large their

relationships are superficial and are

really engaged in for personal gain so

they might get a very attractive partner

because that makes them look good to the

world they might get a wealthy partner

because that will make sure they have

lots of money they might get a famous

partner so that they look good to the

world i mean the the the characteristics

on which they choose the partner are

deeply deeply superficial and so that's

how a narcissist chooses and so when we

look at those areas self uh goal setting

empathy and intimacy that's another way

to view narcissism no matter what it's

just really that it comes down to that

core insecurity that sense they cannot

regulate themselves from the inside out

that they don't have a good sense of

identity and that they're really reliant

on the world for telling them what

they're about which makes them actually

quite resentful a recent study suggests

that one in 16 americans has been

affected by someone with narcissistic

personality disorder so what causes npd

and can it be unlearned

what causes narcissism it's it's there's

actually a lot of pathways to this and

the city of oz that we call narcissism

there's a lot of ways you get there um a

lot of people the big question everyone

has is are you born this way or are you

made

it's mostly made

but there's a little bit of born

and what's the percentage on that i i

you know i i if i were to spit ball i'm

going to go with like an 80 20 or a 90

10 in terms of made versus born i mean

the inborn part is that because the fact

of the matter is we see people come from

invalidating early environments or

overindulged or spoiled in early

environments and they don't turn out

narcissistic so there's got to be

something else at play right and that's

probably where that temperamental piece

comes in kids are likely more

hyper-sensitive hyper-emotional

if you look at marsha linehan's work on

borderline personality disorder she

actually talks about that mix between

the biological vulnerability plus the

invalidation of the early environment

there's likely something like that

happening in narcissism too but it's

mostly made so let's let's view it as

almost concentric circles and let's

start at the middle circle which is

really what happens in the family when

the child is first growing up

children who are children who don't get

consistent emotional mirroring for the

from their parents that's a setup for

becoming a narcissist later on because

that's how children learn to regulate

their emotional worlds they learn how to

self-soothe their emotions they learn

how to take responsibility for their

emotions they learn how to understand

their emotions from how they're mirrored

by their parents and if their parents

have consistent appropriate reactions

and are available to them that's how the

child learns that so if a child for any

number of reasons doesn't have that kind

of consistent feedback from their

parents the parents are distracted the

parents are absent the parents don't

care the parents are addicted to drugs

and are not available in that way all of

those could be contributors to that

parents just are abusive in some way

obviously that can be a contributor too

to inconsistent kinds of mirroring and

then the child doesn't learn like i said

to sort of regulate their own emotion

they keep looking to the environment for

validation because frankly they're

confused we also think about narcissism

in the early environment as a function

of attachment children who have secure

healthy attachments tend to go on to

adulthood and make more secure healthy

attachments but kids who have more

anxious or avoidant attachments

that can set the tone for attachment

issues in adulthood and they're not able

to make those kinds of successful

attachments in adulthood so their

relationships are really fraught with

lots of in and out back and forth rather

than the consistency you'd see from a

secure attachment with a parent

the other thing i often say is that

parents who are nurses parents who

create narcissistic

kids who go on to become narcissistic

adults we see a pattern of simultaneous

over-indulgence

and under-indulgence and what i mean by

that is these are the kids where if they

do the sport their parent wants or get

the straight a's or the prima ballerina

dancer or whatever it is they do the

best violin player

whatever they want to take over dad's

business whatever the thing they say

they want to do if the parents can get a

good public face from it they will over

indulge the kid in that way they'll

drive them to every practice they'll go

out of their way but when that child has

an emotional need that needs to be met

the parents are nowhere to be found like

they're interested when their kids on

stage they're interested when their kids

on the field they're interested when the

child's getting an honor or doing what

they want them to do but when that kid

really needs their emotional needs to be

met it's it's completely an impoverished

environment that's what i mean by being

over and under-indulged

it's also what we call modeling it's

what they see in their environment if

they watch a parent constantly be

entitled they're going to learn to be

entitled if they watch a parent who has

no empathy they're not going to learn

empathy empathy is learned in childhood

you cannot teach a 30 year old how to be

empathic that's an early game so that

that was my question because if if you

were saying that 80 to 90

of becoming a narcissist was taught then

certainly later we could unteach it but

we'd like to think no because you know

what ends up happening is that

ultimately these these environments for

children are inconsistent

they're invalidating at the worst of it

they can be abusive and dehumanizing and

that's the heartbreak is that i've

worked with more than a few folks who

are adult narcissists who did come from

abusive invaliding down downright

definitely who have narcissistic

personality disorder narcissistic

personality disorder so their early

lives were really really sort of

wretched and that's heartbreaking but

that's still not

a

get out of jail free card for treating

other people badly like i'm not getting

i'm not down with that and so but now

let's take that now we're in the family

but we got to push this out a little bit

society is to blame too

we tell kids it's okay at some level to

behave as long as you win

you got into harvard junior great

whatever it took to get there as long as

we start saying that you can shelve

important qualities like compassion

kindness respect

mutuality empathy as long as you're

telling people it's okay to put that

stuff away as long as you succeed our

achievement-oriented culture is a

contributor to these patterns for sure

because we're almost saying empathy is a

waste of time as long as you get

straight a's

you know who needs kindness when you can

write code that's not going to fly you

know so that's the other reason we're

seeing more and more of this and then

you add things like social media and the

kinds of things society values into the

mix

then that's it i mean it's a perfect

storm that's what i'm saying we've got

you got the family you've got the

community you've got the culture at

large and then you have a little bit of

individual temperament thrown in there

forget about it when you hear

how narcissists narcissism is

conditioned i'm surprised that it's only

one to three percent of the population

that has it remember that's narcissistic

personality disorder which requires that

person to have had problems in their

life because of it awareness of it and

feel like it's caused them trouble yeah

because narcissism works as a pattern in

our society too often they don't feel a

lot of distress so when you were talking

about parents mirroring or kids marrying

their parents

there are certain behaviors that i grew

up with right and my parents that i

did until my mid-20s and then i thought

i'm not going to do this anymore this is

not healthy for me it's not nice i'm not

going to do it and so i changed so why

is it that i can change an undesirable

behavior but someone who has

narcissistic personality disorder can't

change because you've got because the

core conflict is that insecurity that

discomfort with themselves that sense of

emptiness that's what has to be

addressed so you may have seen that but

it clearly didn't result in that kind of

core insecurity perhaps in you so when

you were doing the yelling it's like

well this is how it's done and they're

like whoa maybe this other person feels

sad when i'm yelling at them this isn't

okay so you were able to have that

correction because a you were able to

engage in empathy and b you may not have

had that core insecurity remember the

narcissist is absolutely reliant on the

world for validation at all times when

we need someone we resent them

you know a child doesn't but the child

grows you think about an adolescent

every adolescent out there

um

resents their parents why do they resent

their parents because they kind of still

need them they kind of still need them

to be a mom but like i want you to be my

mom i don't want you to be my mom and

they go back and forth and then they

hate you

you know so it's that resentment comes

from need and it's one thing to be five

of course you need your parents that's

built in but when you're 35 45 and you

need people to tell you you're great all

the time you may not be aware of that

need but you are aware that you're

reliant on the world and that if you're

having a bad day that the only way to

spring out of it is to get validation

from the world that stinks

so that's why it's very difficult to

change it's not just about modeling

empathy and there there is an

interesting concept out there and it's

something actually even in my social

media someone that we've engaged on

about this idea of cognitive empathy you

can teach people like that's how he

feels okay got it do you understand why

that would be feel bad got it

that's almost intellectualized and it's

a little bit different than being in the

emotional mock with someone

is it like acting it's not it no it's

not acting it's knowing but it's not

getting

you see what i'm saying i know i know i

know

why

this person would feel upset right now i

know that yeah i might even get it a

little bit

but

i'm not feeling it so much so that it'll

stop my behavior in the future so it's

like a half of a fix and when you're

really in a close intimate relationship

some with someone and the best they can

come up with is like

i suppose i understand why you feel that

way

but they're still not like and they're

not emotionally there with you that's

incredibly unsatisfying it's kind of

like when somebody says well i'm sorry

if you feel that yes narcissist mantra

yeah i'm sorry you feel that that's not

an applause that's not that's not an

apology exactly you have been in a

relationship with a narcissist my myself

yes yes of course okay in different

areas too intimate relationships

familial relationships um

work relationships but just so all of

the mystical knows it's not my

ex-husband he's actually a great father

so

because i'm curious because if 80 to 90

percent is taught

were you hyper aware raising your kids

to not raise a narcissist my

the my ex-husband and i when we were

raising our kids

the one thing we 100 agreed upon he's

like romney we have a lot of things we

have to get right but we looked at each

other and said the one thing we must

make sure we focus on above all else

because we only get one chance to get

this right is empathy

we didn't care how they did in school

we didn't care if they didn't eat their

vegetables we didn't care if they

watched television 10 hours a day we

just needed them to be empathic and

there was a fine day when they were

about eight or nine years old oh my god

we got it

wait was your hold on i have so many

questions was your ex-husband uh a

mental health professional okay so you

have yeah it's not like these kids have

two yeah like

world-renowned mental health experts

parenting them and the two of you both

agreed that empathy was number one

empathy is everything this is huge for

parents to get huge because i'll tell

you it's the core of why kids bully

all the problems we have with kids it

has to be about empathy am i telling you

my kids have had the most smooth ride no

one's kids are i mean and they're

horribly mean to me because they're

teenagers but i will say that i can see

in their face when they go one line too

far as a teenager and they say that one

mean thing and they see my face change

immediately the empathy overtakes them

quicker than their words do their face

changes i've watched my daughters

interact with people and i'll watch how

quickly their face will change when they

sense another human being in need and at

those points i do heave that sigh of

relief whatever path they take i do know

that they're hyper aware of not

hyperware like in a neurotic way but

they're very aware of the the needs and

the feelings of other people and they

will shape their behavior in that way

and that was the only thing that

mattered because i wanted to put two

decent kind human beings into the world

that's really beautiful

i bet if i lined up a hundred parents

and asked them

if you could only

give your kid one thing what would it be

i don't think one of them would say

empathy that's terrible because i'll

tell you i would the world has enough

smart people and it turns out they do

well in school but if i had to choose if

somebody said you could give up your kid

getting into like a top college or

something and trade that out for empathy

i'd be like hell no

she could go i don't care what she does

but i would not let her give because

parents are concerned they're sharing

you know kindness being honest

diligent hard-working i've never heard

empathy yeah it's ever it was everything

the way i raised them in fact even how i

breastfed my kids i'm like i'm gonna

stare at them face to face i'm never

going to be distracted as much as i can

in the middle of the night i would fall

asleep i would stare at him face to face

like i started that one early i'm like

i'm mirroring these kids that was that

important to me that was important to me

it was that important guys this is huge

for the parents out there getting that

because this is this is

the leading expert on narcissism and a

lot of other mental health topics and

her ex-husband both have that shared

goal that had to be narcissism i mean

yeah right it had to be empathy wow

because i think that that's that's to

pay it forward that's going to make them

better mothers it's going to make them

better partners it's going to make them

better workers it's going to make them

better leaders it's going to make them

better friends they win everywhere on

that one that's the only quality to me

that matters in a human being and so

there from ev from there all other

things would be built out whatever they

do now you

briefly mentioned that around the age of

eight or nine there was a moment that

you said ah

what was that they were i was actually

watching my daughter play with another

child and then something happened with

what the child was eating or interacting

with and so that child no longer had

that thing and my daughter still had it

might have been like ice cream or

something fell out of a dish

and her face

you could see that she's she almost got

she expected she experienced that person

child's feeling before that child

experienced her feeling and you could

see the hurt in her face and then she's

like we have to help them we have to

help them and i'm like oh sweetie don't

worry about i think she was worried

about the cost and she was even being

empathic she knew i was struggling a

little financially at that point and to

buy another ice cream was gonna cost

money and she's like is it gonna be okay

to get them another i said of course

sweetheart and then we ameliorated the

situation and got a new ice cream but

her caring for me having enough money

that child suffering it was like it

really you know she wasn't like should i

cut mine in half but i already put my

germs in it you know the way a kid

thinks it was so it was absolutely

automatic for her and you know and we

were very lucky they our children went

to an infant care center actually at

ucla where empathy was the main thing

talk to them all day long so you can

build this into caregiving models of you

know and i think that started in infant

care it was in their preschools it was

in their k through i mean i mean

high school it gets harder but it's you

know we'll see how it goes for them like

i said as teenagers it doesn't always

feel like empathy but i see it with

their friends everyone but me and i'm

fine with that

for now yeah they'll become your friends

later um

so eight or nine years old you saw this

empath these empathetic traits earlier

but then it was clear they knew it was

automatic for them when are you

when do people start to exhibit signs of

narcissism here's where we need to be

careful

almost by definition all teenagers look

narcissistic yeah they're deeply

entitled they're arrogant they think

they know they're the uh

uh

what's the type of narcissist i compared

them to david them

you would call them maybe one of the

benign nurses the benign narcissist and

i think that's what it is it is more of

the benign narcissism and i think like

that's why i'd be very loathe to use

that term within adolescence i always

say that adolescence is like wearing a

sweater that's way too big for them

they're just growing into their

personalities they're trying to figure

it out their bodies are changing the

world treats them as like an adult for

one hour as a child for another hour so

it's just hard to say we're a teenager

it really really is it's hard to

interact with a teenager so that

combination means like we're just trying

to put a label on it also i say don't

even use that word with adolescence even

though the pattern seems to fit

i wouldn't start really sort of saying

this pattern's making me super

uncomfortable probably until their early

20s like it's really in place and they

haven't kind of grown out of it whether

they've gone to college or military

service or like trained in a job or

something some of that should be

correcting at that point and that's why

i would really really look for it in

earnest but i would still look for some

of the key issues that they are empathic

as adolescents when they need to be they

may not be to the parents but they

should be with their friends and other

folks in their purview you know are they

really entitled they really believe they

deserve special treatment or you know

kids making noise in a restaurant sure

that's going to happen but like a kid

walking up and saying hey why should i

have to wait in line you know i'm too

important that's the problem yeah all

right well that

that was such a

wonderful explanation of of causes and

there are seven signs to look out for

when spotting a narcissist we're gonna

go through those one by one what's the

first one so the first one's lack of

empathy okay and that's a defining

characteristics

that's a defining characteristic of

narcissism in fact if i see that

somebody has really well preserved

empathy i'm like nah not even happening

so that that to me almost is the

requirement it's the bedrock of this

pattern the second is entitlement

entitlement is that sense is that that

somehow someone is

should deserve special treatment even if

to the detriment of other people that

somehow they are different than everyone

else again sort of special by dentif

their existence

the third is grandiosity it's sort of an

unrealistic assessment of one's capacity

or abilities or they talk about a

grandiose world that they don't even

live in the things that they may someday

do you know someday i'm going to climb

mount everest so they talk about it as

though it's something they're actively

doing or have already done so it's it is

a it is again a very unrealistic almost

fantasy like version of the world

they'll often talk about having one day

the greatest love affair or the greatest

love story or the greatest wedding or

the greatest career everything is just

bigger and larger than life

number four is superficiality there's a

very vapid quality to narcissism they're

really only concerned about appearances

how a person looks um what a person owns

where they live what they drive what

they carry their shoes on their feet

it's very very superficial to the

detriment of other characteristics

somebody out there might say oh but i

love fashion but they're a very sweet

kind person that's not what we're

talking about we're talking about

superficiality with absolutely no depth

behind it or judging people solely on

superficial

characteristics and quality

number five is chronic seeking of

admiration or validation it's the

constant need to be be receiving praise

recognition and nowadays that's really

amped up because of social media that

they have to get likes and they have to

get lots of traction on their social

media page and they need lots of

followers and all of that so it's that

constant but it never stops if you're

even close to them like you're their

child or you're their partner you have

to constantly be telling them how

wonderful they are and how great they

are and way beyond the thing that

they've done it's almost a nuisance to

get a gift from a narcissist because you

have to thank them for it so many times

it had been easier to buy it yourself

um

number six is their tendency to rage

they don't they don't have good command

of their emotions they tend to be all

over the map and the one emotion they

tend to manifest the most often is

uncontrolled rage that's often because

they're so frustrated and they're so

insecure and they don't have good ways

of dealing with their feelings so it's

not unusual for them to just come out

when things don't go their way they

don't have any tolerance for frustration

so you'll see a lot of rage that comes

out

and number seven i'd really say is

arrogance it's um i'm better than you

and in some ways that sort of draws from

the grandiosity it draws from the

entitlement but it can come off as a

snobbery as a dismissiveness as a

devaluation as an invalidation of other

people just sort of like sweeping them

away and so those are some of the seven

key character characteristics in my book

i actually lay out what i call 31

characteristics it's like i think it's a

lot more than just the seven and it

takes in a lot more territory jealousy

envy getting pleasure out of other

people's misery um

lying cheating um

you know things all a lot of really

negative interpersonal patterns people

who are narcissistic often engage in

projection they make their faults and

flaws yours like i didn't say that i

didn't do that you they'll accuse you of

something they did and they'll blink

you'll often be quite confused they

engage in dynamics like gaslighting

where they question your reality and

make you feel like you're literally

losing your mind like that never had

they'll say things like that never

happened you know but

but it did but it did and then you'll

start questioning yourself

right and people who spend enough time

with narcissists find themselves plagued

with self-doubt because narcissists so

question they're oh so often question

their reality so with those seven do

they have to have all seven of those you

know the dsm has a list of nine which

takes in most of those you only need

five of the nine plus this idea that

life isn't going well that distress to

get it in the dsm i often i'm actually a

little more generous i say like you need

to have like if you have all if you have

five of those seven you're in trouble

but the emp the lack of empathy is the

requirement to me oh everything so it's

like that plus four or five others and

a huge

takeaway for me was in our last episode

when you talk about empathy and how it

related to raising your kids so if you

haven't seen that episode make sure you

go back one and take a look there

because that was just absolutely for me

phenomenal phenomenal um

how quickly if i'm just at a party and i

meet people can i

find out if someone's a narcissist i

mean i'm a pro and i'm in and out in 15

seconds like i got this thing

i got this like before i even wait wait

so it's a fighter depression our session

is gonna be 15 seconds you can you know

what he's at a party it's almost easier

right because i know it's kind of mean i

probably like cast out a few

it might take me longer some people if

there are narcissists you're going to be

able to tell quickly sometimes it takes

you a little longer if it's a bit more

subtle or covert or something like that

but it can happen pretty quickly you

know watch the back and forth of the

conversation

is there a genuine curiousness

about you like do you do you walk up to

them and say hi nice to meet you i'm

romini and you'll say hi i'm kyle and

then it's the kyle show

and by the time this conversation is

done there's no sense of anything about

me and not even an opportunity for me to

have offered that

you know it also might be how they

conduct themselves in that like do they

just keep talking about themselves and

only in these sort of unrealistically

glowing terms do they almost seem too

but that the other extreme they also may

be a little bit too slick and too smooth

like you know maybe not like they're

coming on to you but like it's just

almost too charming i find charming

people terrifying because i know that's

often like the soft sign that

psychopathy or narcissism is coming

around the corner so charming people i

actually like uncharming people like the

more socially awkward you are the more

i'm like this could be a real sure

this is great yeah wonderful sign me up

so if i meet somebody and i suspect

they're a narcissist because they're

only talking about themselves they're

not interested in me at all they're very

grandiose in their uh the content that

they're putting out there

are there any questions i could ask them

that could give me some

instant feedback you know what you can

do is ask them something that has more

that pulls them away from talking about

their work like let's say they're

talking bragging about work work work

they're sort of like only talking about

one thing try to change it to something

else like what are the things that bring

you joy like really ask them like a

feely question

and they feel like

like they just sort of like become like

huh

feeling

i'm going to go get another martini like

they run away that's probably a sign

like if you it's sort of a game for me

at a party if i think i've met a

narcissist i'll say can you tell me

about a little bit about your inner

world because i know what you do now and

the i'll often get people who look at me

like i just i'm speaking in tongues and

they'll often say i see someone over

there i gotta go

and they'll often really cut the

conversation people are gonna be so

nervous when they meet you at a party

now like hey by the way i'm not a

narcissist i know i tell you i'm not

sure like i'm out um that's also a show

i would definitely watch you on with a

hidden camera just meeting people yeah

yeah in la it's actually it's it's

bloodsport here because it's good

it's fishing with dynamite well it's

like growing it's like seashell

collecting yeah at the end of a party

you've got like enough you've got it i

mean

i know we joke about how narcissistic la

is but it really is true it really is

true yeah we live here we work here it's

a insanity it really is

yeah but here's one thing that you want

to be i mean again i don't want people

dismissing people in like the first 15

seconds they need them let's say someone

does talk about themselves a lot the

other thing you do want to be mindful of

is they may be socially anxious

so they may have trouble kind of taking

and rolling with it that's why i'm

saying if you could slow the

conversation down maybe even make it

about something that's happening around

you like something very sweet like

something that you know they're drinking

or something special they may be wearing

with but making them make it more

special not like well this is the

designer label but try to make it about

the moment what's personal and see where

they can go with it to share a little of

yourself also start talking about

yourself a little they've done their

whole dog and pony show

see what happens when you start talking

about yourself if they glaze over or

they start using their phone at that

point

not a good sign

if i do find myself in a situation

where i'm in a relationship whether it's

romantic or otherwise with a narcissist

what can i do

wait well that's you know here it is

it's gonna it's gonna be painful if you

really and by the time a lot of people

detect these patterns it's been years

sometimes

if we're lucky they don't have kids

together

because that can start getting messy if

the relationship goes south because a

custody battle with a narcissist

is is

it's war it's it's one of the most

painful things i've ever witnessed if

you sense that that's where things are

going

you need to get yourself into therapy

right away and you want to get the

couple into therapy the challenge with

couples therapy with a narcissist is

unless you've got one very skilled

therapist that narcissist can really

play the therapist

and i've seen that happen many many

times you want to be really really

careful how do they play the therapist

they win them over they charm them and

sometimes the narcissist is sort of the

more

materially successful or the more

successful seeming partner and they'll

kind of

again they'll charm them they'll charm

them you have to be somebody who just

dislikes charm to really not be charmed

right so they'll really play them and

work them and and flatter them and

narcissists actually are quite good at

sort of sniffing out

how to validate another person because

they are they need it so much they're

really good at dispensing it when they

need to wow so they can really work the

game but it's important you get therapy

you consider getting yourselves into

therapy you pay attention to the

patterns and you really have to do some

hard looks into the mirror on if

if this is as good as it's ever going to

get which is probably the case can you

live with this forever that's the

question and if it's if you don't like

that then you've got one of two paths

either you've got to adjust your

expectations this is how it's always

going to be or you got to get out well

and those two paths is what we will be

discussing next you you mentioned to me

off camera that there are people in a

relationship with a narcissist and they

don't even really realize that they're

being abused yeah explain that there's a

couple of reasons that could happen one

is what i call sort of the historical

reason they may have come from a family

where one or both parents or someone's

significant in a family system was

narcissistic or abusive so for them

abuse and

relationships go together went back to

the mirroring thing right so they just

don't even like everyone's gonna that's

all i deserve this is how i'm treated

and so they're often an easy mark for

getting in with a narcissist whereas

other people might have already broken

up with the narcissist they end up with

they stick it out because it's almost a

sense of they they were sort of raised

up in that and so they don't even think

they deserve more or they just don't

question it and so they're used to

saying well maybe if i try harder

they'll love me maybe if i try harder so

it can it becomes a sense of

it's a self-blame the self-approach i

this is my fault they're telling me that

they're yelling at me because i didn't

keep the house clean or i don't look

good or

the kids were noisy or i don't make

enough money or i'm out of the house too

much or whatever the reasons are and

they actually blame themselves keep

thinking if i fix this this and this

then maybe this will turn around

and what types of relationships do you

find

narcissism a problem the most i would

say where you know listen the two sets

of relationships where i think it is

most problematic is in an intimate

partnership like a husband wife

boyfriend girlfriend kind of thing or a

parental relationship when it is your

parent because the parental relationship

is if you have a narcissistic mother or

father or perhaps step parent

that sets a tone that you're going to

take into adulthood and it's going to

color how you choose a partner what you

endure in a job it just your your own

sense of self-worth so many things in

the long term can get harmed by having a

narcissistic parent it's not it's by no

means a sentence and i've seen many

people have had brutally narcissistic

parents who go on to joyful lives so

it's not like you're doomed but it

definitely is a vulnerability then in

the flip side is obviously when you meet

someone and you think you believe you've

fallen in love with them and you try to

make a life with them and they spend

their days dehumanizing you invalidating

you yelling at you putting you down

disrespecting you that's miserable and

you really you might stick it out

because you feel like you have to or i'm

not loving them well enough it's you

know sort of what i call the beauty and

the beast fantasy maybe if i love the

beast enough he'll turn into a prince

and there's a lot of people who sort of

fall into that bucket and so it those

are the two relationships where i see

it's the most harmful but you know

listen if you have a narcissistic boss

they can throw off your career if you

have a narcissistic sibling you might

feel like you don't have a confident but

i do think the parents the partners

that's really where the rubber meets the

road

what triggers narcissist narcissistic

abuse

well what triggers narcissistic abuse is

the insecurity and the ego of the

narcissist being threatened and they

explode with narcissistic rage the

problem is for a while you can't figure

out what it is that's setting this

narcissist off it can often be the

littlest slight it could be that they

had a bad day somewhere else and they're

taking it out on you it's like coming

home and yelling at a pet because you

can't yell at your boss kind of thing so

you don't know what the thing that set

it off but all you do know for sure is

somewhere along the day their ego got

injured they felt out of control their

insecurity boiled over and it's the

people closest to them that often feel

like they're easiest targets especially

if you keep forgiving them and giving

them second chances then they're like oh

this is great i can keep coming home and

doing this get all my rage out this

person's still sticking around great

would a narcissist date somebody for

let's say five years then get married

and then

start the abuse no a lot of people say

well they became narcissistic after we

were married i was like oh no they did

not that's good to know the first date

it was there narcissism is a pattern

that's that that you bring into it from

early adulthood on i mean it was

developing all along right but it's

there from the jump and when we do sort

of the autopsy on the relationship and

really go right back to the beginning

they'll say

yeah i guess he was late to all our

first few dates and there was a lot of

really poor boundaries and

one time he got screamed at me because i

mistakenly ate his order of fried rice

or whatever it may be that the patterns

were there they just were romanticizing

it because like and he wanted to spend

all this time with me wanted to be with

me 24 7. that's amazing alarm bell

that's really controlling this this

series is about narcissism as a general

uh topic however

i look at this a lot as

the

the the series to watch if you're going

to start dating amen

this

knowing this information having this

power having this education

allows you to avoid

5 10 15 20 maybe 40 years of disaster

you better believe that prevention in

this case is the best cure if we could

keep people from getting these

relationships in the first place because

what you got to remember is i've known

people who actually were well put

together kind empathic relatively

confident they'd get into a relationship

with a narcissist 15 years later they're

a shell of their prior selves they're

riddled with self-doubt they they've

complete an utter loss of self-esteem

they don't know which way is up they

completely think they're undeserving i

mean it really does a number on them

from the inside out so if we could stop

it from the first place because what

ends up happening is once a person's in

people will often fight for a

relationship

so that's where you want to stop them

from getting in in the first place and

especially if you have kids oh once

you're especially if you're financially

dependent on that and many narcissists

try to make their partner financially

dependent on them they ensure that they

quit their jobs or you know make it so

that because that's one way they can

make sure that person doesn't leave them

and allows them to control them because

control is a big part of the

narcissistic dynamic yeah

it's i'm i'm so thankful that i'm

learning all this um

if you find yourself getting getting

abused by a narcissist in a romantic

relationship what are your tips for that

person if you're being abused in a

narcissistic relationship first of all

i'm always going to say especially to

med circle listeners if you're being

physically abused or any other abuse

that's putting yourself or other or

children or other dependent adults in

that environment at danger you must get

help and i'm hoping med circle might

even be able to put like a connection to

the national domestic

hotline because you've got to get help

immediately um that's that's that's a

danger in a risk situation beyond that

we're really getting also into

psychological abuse which and emotional

abuse which to me are equally harmful

equally harmful as physical abuse that

you need to ensure that you're getting

appropriate mental health services uh

perhaps even through a support group

that other people being affected by this

narcissistic abuse like kids are getting

mental health services because they're

seeing this happen

make sure that you take care of you

because it's very easy for your health

to fail when you're in a relationship

with the narcissist i've seen people get

very very ill due to a variety of stress

related illnesses and i had to wonder

how much of this was really due to years

of being in a relationship with a

narcissist

cultivate other support networks people

who are narcissistic often try to

isolate their partners they don't want

them to get the support and validation

of other people so break out of that

isolation if it's friends at work

friends at your spiritual community your

church your temple whatever you know but

find a way to get those people you can

someone at the gym

somewhere create friendships in other

spaces so you don't get too far down the

rabbit hole family members just to get

that dose of reality that kind of thing

all of those things become important you

need a reality check a lot of times

people it's almost like you want people

to see you with that person but here's

the thing a lot of time narcissistic

people don't verbally abuse their

partners in front of other people

they're smart enough to know they gotta

look good to the public and they save

that for behind closed doors or in the

car or whatever

yeah that's what i was just thinking is

first having the courage and education

and wherewithal to know i'm in this

scenario yeah this is this is bad this

is hurting me and it's likely because of

this yeah i think people are afraid to

admit that they're very they're ashamed

there's a lot of shame it's so sad i've

worked with many people who are in a

relationship with a narcissist and they

were horribly ashamed and embarrassed

that they let it get this far and i said

you know what it's not like it went from

this to this in a day no this has been

happening over time and you've almost

sadly slowly been adjusting to this

change in the climate and now you're

here and yes it looks gruesome from here

but this didn't happen overnight and

we're not going to be able to undo it

overnight yeah it's the frog it's the

frog

yeah but the frog can still jump out

yeah so yeah but until the frog gets

boiled to death yes that's the problem

we're trying to catch people before that

yes we are

what about people who are who have a

work relationship uh and their their

co-worker is narcissistic and abusing

them how do they handle that

when you have a co-worker who's behaving

in that way you've really got to protect

your interests because most hr

departments can't do much without

documentation

i tell people when you're in that

situation you as soon as you start a new

job create little email folders for

everyone you work with and save

everything hopefully you never need it

and 40 years down the road you had the

most exam wonderful career and you just

they clear out your account and it's

done now it's not going to be most

people so you save everything and it

starts to get a little wonky and you

have to be very careful because if it's

a company server you may need to print

hard copies of these emails you may not

have access to that you may not be able

to do stuff with that at work make sure

you create files when you work with

difficult co-workers save every email

save text messages

i mean we're talking everything um

when you try to avoid meeting with them

one-on-one alone if that's possible if

you can have someone else in the room

with you and you know it may sound weird

you don't have to make it hostile but

try to make it that there's other people

present because then that gives you you

know again another another set of ears

however if you can't have that one thing

i recommend people who have a

narcissistic co-worker they're concerned

about create a memo after the meeting

send the memo say i just want to make

sure that this is a very clear review of

what we just met use quotes wherever

possible put a read receipt on the email

so you know they received the memo and

then keep that as a keep these things as

records and so you really want to ensure

that you have that because you can't do

much in terms of hr or with an attorney

until you have all of that but we also

know

that workplace stress is actually the

type of stress most associated with

developing physical illness so it really

is important that we manage your

workplace stress once again consider

getting therapy have a safe confidential

space don't don't don't make this about

workplace gossip it's so easy to have

those whispered conversations then

you're the one who might end up getting

into trouble don't post your words it's

not going to attract anything not going

to fix anything don't put your workplace

strife on social media if you have a

narcissistic co-worker and they don't go

and they decide to go there don't get in

the mud with them you've got to play a

clean game when it's this kind of

situation make sure you engage in

self-care and then you might want to

slowly but surely if you feel like the

writing's on the wall let's say this

narcissistic co-worker has outlasted

everyone yeah maybe that the culture of

the company is that they're not going to

get rid of this person maybe it's the

boss exactly and if it's the boss you

have even more problems same rules but

you may need to start working on an exit

strategy sadly we do know that there's

some interesting research that has come

out that when people work in a

narcissist like with a toxic

narcissistic boss that you'll sometimes

find that they band together and do some

interesting work together can actually

cause like when you're united around a

common enemy that can create something

interesting the boss is narcissistic and

the co the workers might actually all

unite so that can sometimes be a nice

downstream effect make sure you have

allies at work you know

people you can turn to not for gossip

but just to ensure that you're

protecting yourself but also realize you

may need to cut your losses it may be

the dream job but it's not the dream job

if you're working with toxic colleagues

slowly craft an escape strategy and do

it quietly because in some places they

may be vindictive enough to stop you

from trying to get a new position it can

get really dark really really fast i

hope people have their pen and paper out

for that because that was a lot of

actionable amazing tips

what about the support okay

i have a friend who's in a relationship

with a narcissist how do i help that

friend

number one

do

not call their partner out because that

person is going to feel the need to

defend their partner don't okay don't

call don't call the partner out in any

circumstance no definitely point out the

patterns and the behaviors and listen

non-judgmentally it can be very

overwhelming it's so hard because you

want to say here's my text

right now and to say you really want to

say

it it hurts to hear this

it must be heard even more to be

experiencing it that's good you know so

when someone you love is telling you

that they're being hurt in a

relationship your temptation is just one

to go tear that person's throat out be

with your friends pain but don't give

them an unrealistic plan say right now

we're going to your house we're getting

your stuff we're getting out they may

not be willing to do that and that might

scare them to even talk with you more

listen listen non-judgmentally tell them

like this doesn't feel okay this feels

like abuse to me are you okay and then

ask them the dollar question

how can i help

we all want to give advice we all want

to get in there and fix it how can i

help your friend may say you know what

you're helping just listen you know and

i'm going to be calling you in the

middle of the night and say i'm here

instead of saying okay let's rent you an

apartment right now let's do this right

now you know

that's overwhelming and a person may be

really really freaked out so when our

when our our loved ones are struggling

we often want to get in there and do

what i call casseroling like somebody

died here's a tuna casserole i'm like i

don't know that they want that maybe

they just need you to listen and if they

want a tuna casserole trust me i'll tell

you

yeah so

ask them how can i help in

conducting all these interviews with you

and lots of other experts

the power of asking

a question

to somebody you love

is probably the best way to show support

if you ask it without judgment yes if

you ask it with sincerity and if you ask

it without trying to get anything from

them not like well do you think moving

would help that's not the right question

right but how can i help

i'm sorry you're going through that that

must be tough those questions

i mean are so simple they're so easy

they're huge and also don't second-guess

them a person in a narcissistic

relationship is being second-guessed and

doubted 100 times a day the last thing

you want to do is say

are you sure that's happening that's

gaslighting your friend and that's you

now you're participating in the abuse

yes you know i mean you listen to your

friend why is your friend gonna lie

about this and if this is their track

record of lying about this stuff you

need to find a new get a new friend you

know so i mean but you really if this is

because odds are by the time they're

coming and telling you this it's been

going on for a while yes

wow

uh

i loved everything that you put out here

because it gave me

one big sigh of relief that there is

hope

people are out there dealing with a

narcissist you know the thing that

happens to people who are narcissistic

relationships is a phenomenon we call

learned helplessness

you know theoretical model that came out

in the 1970s but when it plays out here

a person in a relationship with a

narcissist feels that nothing they do

helps no matter what they say what they

do

how they communicate how they look

anything ever changes anything

so they start feeling helpless and they

get paralyzed and then they get stuck

and many times they often become can

also become depressed because learned

helplessness is considered to be part of

the developmental model of depression so

it is a it's that sense of nothing i'm

doing is working when you're in a

relationship with someone and you feel

like nothing you're doing is working

that could be a real ringer that you're

in a relationship with a narcissist well

luckily we provided plenty of tips

plenty of actionable steps for people to

take but the question remains is there

hope for the narcissist themselves dr

romney okay so first of all you gotta

you gotta get him into the therapy room

right

so

most narcissists do not come into

therapy saying

hi

i'm a narcissist yes and i need some

therapy yeah i had i did have one person

in my career do that and literally

walked in the door that's what he said

i'm a narcissist and i want therapy i

said have a seat let's see what we can

do

and well hold on and was he a narcissist

what a narcissistic personality disorder

yeah and what kind of health did he get

it's long-term insight-oriented work but

it's slow it's really really slow and

he's very committed

to growing to

to doing better he wants this and it's

it's an incredibly slow process and this

is a guy who wants it

so

when people say is there a treatment

model that works well with them i would

say we typically learn a person is

narcissistic in therapy because they

came in with some other problem i'm

having problems with my girlfriend it

might be substance use i've been feeling

sad work isn't going well i'm not

getting along with my boss

i'm mad at my mother so they'll come in

with something else

and then they'll tell you their story

and maybe by the first or second session

they'll be like oh i'm getting this you

might even notice in the first session

because there'll be a real antagonism

from them to you

is the sorry but

we mentioned in a previous episode very

quickly you can spot if someone's a

narcissist you specifically if you're at

a party in a therapy session it takes

you one longer is it because they're

guarded they're guarded and we're having

a very curated kind of conversation

we're getting a history and all of that

you might pick some of the top notes up

pretty quickly like they'll talk about

all their achievements and i once had

somebody say you want to know how many

cars i own let me tell you how many cars

i own one person said i could buy and

sell you 20 times over and i was

thinking more like 40 but okay um you

know so some of it's like like right out

there like you'd really what is your

reaction when someone says that you know

i mean utter humility i'm like that you

know that's so interesting but i

actually don't care

so let's you know okay did you say you

don't care then what do they say they'll

say they'll look offended and i'll say

you know i'm actually trying to learn

your inner world the other stuff that's

that's all fluff to me

you know so please tell me about we're

going to work on this inside and that's

of course terrifying because those

shelves are a lot more empty yeah that's

why they have 20 cars exactly that's

right 20 cars but you know there's no

kind of there's nothing but room at the

end kind of thing so it's that that's

the struggle but

i have to say that you often end up

working on the thing they came into

therapy with the relationship problem

the substance use issue whatever it is

okay

but then you start working backwards on

the other you know we dig deeper what

was childhood like what was you know

how do they manage frustration how do

they manage anger and rage a lot of the

work of therapy in working with a

narcissistic client is building a

trusting therapeutic alliance

you gotta like them and i gotta tell you

i've worked some people brutally

brutally narcissistic i like them i mean

some of them i've really liked i could

i'm like wow i see the vulnerability and

i'll even say that i'll say i see the

beautiful little boy and i'm so sad the

world missed out on this and they'll cry

and they'll cry a lot you know like and

i'll see it like there's and they're not

playing

there's no point i'm gonna get paid the

same whether or not i'm saying nice

stuff you know what i'm saying like it's

not like i get a paid on per compliment

basis true right so

you're trying to you want to make you

want to get them to come in every week

because something's happening sometimes

i try to outplay or outwit you and tell

you i know more things than you and i

said you know what i'm always i'm always

a student so teach me so what i don't do

is get in the mud with them i don't

defend myself you know if they don't

feel you know if they don't feel like

i'm good enough and i've heard that like

you know you're not that good i'll say

that's absolutely important they feel i

am good and i have a list of referrals

and i pull it out of my desk and i say i

actually highly recommend these

therapists as well so they're used to

people going you know going you know

head to head with them i don't play that

game and i think good therapists who

work with narcissists don't so it's

really that you work on the current

issue you work backwards you try to

create a strong consistent empathic

therapeutic alliance when they tell you

a sad story you genuinely feel sadness

you'll say my gosh that's so sad and you

know what i'll often get is i never

thought of it that way and i'll say

really because i'm actually feeling that

inside and then we'll break that down

wow the difference in our two emotional

experiences so you sort of learn in the

moment i try to work on mindfulness

techniques with them like how do they

catch themselves before they say the

hurtful words how do they manage the

anger what's the sort we ask them what

the source of the anger is so it's

really about it's cognitive behavioral

work but it's a lot of it's humanistic

work

there is something good in there and my

job it's almost like being a prospector

we're going to find it yeah we're going

to show it to them and we're going to

cultivate it and so it's some of its

existential work can they learn to start

taking responsibility for the hurts they

perpetrate on other people and perhaps

try to find another path next time

if you're willing to do that kind of

depth work we might be able to get you

somewhere but it is they're baby steps

let's say a really high functioning

empathic solid person is sitting up here

the kind of person is going to take care

of you if you're sick and is there for

you and doesn't need validation all the

time okay and a narcissist is down here

okay

or even down here we're not getting them

here right we're not getting them here

we're going to get him here and maybe

that's enough that might be enough to

say all right i'll stay in the marriage

i realize it's not satisfying or

someone's like all right i'll try to

cultivate a relationship with my dad but

realize it may not be what i wanted or

yeah okay like you know i can try to

keep working with this person if you

getting them from here to here is

herculean this isn't possible and if

this is the standard it's not going to

fly

one of the traits of a narcissist is

that they lie

and one of the keys to successful

therapy is honesty yeah so how do

you make that happen depends on what

they're lying about it depends on what

they're lying about

they may lie about certain

ridiculous kinds of achievements

they might exaggerate the carat weight

of a diamond ring or the price of a

purse it's such nonsense i wouldn't know

you know what i'm saying you tell me the

bag or the car costs this much it's

irrelevant it's really things like are

they lying about whether or not they're

using substances

are they being honest about something we

made an agreement to be honest about and

be making that a high stakes game like

it's almost like a contract you make

with them say this is only going to work

if you're honest with me the

confidentiality brought about by therapy

helps a lot because you can't say like

hey i'm going to call all your friends

and say that blah blah blah you're

having an affair or something like that

that's not i'm not going to do that

right so it sort of stops kind of there

and um

so it is it's about creating that

becomes an honest space the lying really

there's no incentive

they're not trying to date me so i'm not

going to be impressed by their car you

know what i'm saying because nothing

like that is happening so it's in some

ways you might have to catch them in

their patterns like gosh you come in

here a lot and you talk a lot about all

the stuff you have and while i'm sure

you enjoy it and while i'm sure it's

beautiful it's really not relevant in

here and it's getting in the way of me

getting to know you

you know and so you're kind of taking

away their usual um their usual tools

are there medications that can work

depends on what else an art person with

narcissism is living with everyone

wishes there was a magic pill of course

everyone beg there's got to be something

he could take there's no jerk pill yeah

like if there was the anti-jerk pill big

pharma would be making more money than

they already are just me okay so

sometimes people will try things like

antidepressants with people with

narcissism because they are having sort

of an irritable edge sometimes it works

sometimes it doesn't sometimes people

use anti-anxiety medication with

narcissists because they're having

anxiety about a specific situation in

their life typically because they're not

getting enough validation sometimes

they'll be drugs used to manage issues

around addiction but that's much more

specific to the addiction and it's not

going to address the narcissism

but it would be the other things kind of

hanging out with the narcissism that

you'd use medication for there is no

known medication out there that is

labeled for use to manage or treat

narcissistic personality disorder

or narcissistic traits

if a couple is in therapy or couples

that you've personally had have you ever

suggested to the non-narcissist and in

the couple

leave

if i'm working with a couple i've never

done that but

god i've been tempted i mean like you

almost wanted to slip them a note like

on their way out right ethically it's

not how i roll

if there's a case of domestic violence
